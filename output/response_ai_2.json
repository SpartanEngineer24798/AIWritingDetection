The first shell (also known as the ground state or lowest energy level) can hold up to 2 electrons. This is because it only has one subshell (1s) which can hold 2 electrons. The second shell can hold up to 8 electrons, divided between two subshells (2s and 2p). The 2s subshell can hold 2 electrons and the 2p subshell can hold 6. For the third shell, it can hold up to 18 electrons spread over three subshells (3s, 3p, and 3d). This pattern extends to the higher energy levels. However, the energy levels overlap, so filling of the shells does not necessarily follow a strict sequence. This principle is stated succinctly by what's known as the Aufbau principle. Keep in mind that, according to the Pauli exclusion principle, each subshell can hold only two electrons with opposite spins."}
