This genre is a fusion of house music with elements of synth and electro pop, which is characterized by its heavy bass and a tempo around 130 beats per minute. Beyond this, the Bloody Beetroots exhibits a propinquity towards diverse genres such as dance-punk, dubstep, and indie rock. They are also renowned for their aggressive and energetic arrangements, featuring distorted synthesizer sounds. This adaptability leads some to classify their music within a sub-genre of electronic music often referred to as \"dub-house\" or \"punk-house\", given its organic fusion of dubstep and punk elements with the fundamental electro house base. Ultimately, the Bloody Beetroots embody a composite, transformative dimension in the landscape of electronic music, pushing boundaries with their experimental approach."}
