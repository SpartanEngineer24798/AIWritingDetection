["Black Friday is the day following Thanksgiving Day in the United States , often regarded as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season.This was taken to a new extreme in 2011, when several retailers (including Target , Kohl's , Macy's , Best Buy , and Bealls ) opened at midnight for the first time.In 2012, Walmart and several other retailers announced that they would open most of their stores at 8:00 p.m. on Thanksgiving Day (except in states where opening on Thanksgiving is prohibited due to blue laws , such as Massachusetts where they still opened around midnight), prompting calls for a walkout among some workers."]
