['Dim sum () refers to a style of Cantonese food prepared as small bite-sized or individual portions of food traditionally served in small steamer baskets or on small plates.Dim sum is also well known for the unique way it is served in some restaurants, wherein fully cooked and ready-to-serve dim sum dishes are carted around the restaurant for customers to choose their orders while seated at their tables.Eating dim sum at a restaurant is usually known in Cantonese as going to "drink tea" ( yum cha , 飲茶), as tea is typically served with dim sum.']
