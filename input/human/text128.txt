Erosion is the process by which soil and rock are removed from the Earth's surface by exogenetic processes such as wind or water flow, and then transported and deposited in other locations.Water and wind erosion are now the two primary causes of land degradation ; combined, they are responsible for 84% of degraded acreage, making excessive erosion one of the most significant global environmental problems.
