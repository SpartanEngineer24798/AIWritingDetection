Written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney , and recorded in October 1963, it was the first Beatles record to be made using four-track equipment.With advance orders exceeding one million copies in the United Kingdom, "I Want to Hold Your Hand" would ordinarily have gone straight to the top of the British record charts on its day of release (29 November 1963) had it not been blocked by the group\'s first million seller " She Loves You ", the Beatles\' previous UK single, which was having a resurgent spell in the top position following intense media coverage of the group.
