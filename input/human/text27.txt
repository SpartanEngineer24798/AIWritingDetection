["A season is a subdivision of the year , marked by changes in weather , ecology , and hours of daylight .Seasons result from the yearly revolution of the Earth around the Sun and the tilt of the Earth's axis relative to the plane of revolution.It is the tilt of the Earth that causes the Sun to be higher in the sky during the summer months which increases the solar flux ."]
