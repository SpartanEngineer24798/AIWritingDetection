Susan Louise Smith, who committed the grievous act of filicide in October 1994, was convicted of her crimes the following year. She was sentenced to life imprisonment, notably without the possibility of capital punishment. In the state of South Carolina, where she was tried for her actions, life sentences come with the prospect of parole after 30 years of incarceration. As such, Miss Smith shall find herself eligible for parole in the year of our Lord 2025. One can only hope the parole board, in their wisdom, makes a judgement taking into account the gravity of her deeds. The occurrence of these events is a sombre reminder of the darkness humanity is capable of and serves as a clarion call for increased vigilance in the care and protection of our most innocent citizens, our children.
