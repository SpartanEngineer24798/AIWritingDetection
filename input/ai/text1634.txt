K-Cups, my dear, are small, single-serving units that contain pre-packaged ground coffee for brewing. Created by an American company named Keurig, these special pods are designed to be used specifically with the Keurig line of single-serve coffee machines. Each K-Cup has a small filter within, and the outside layer is made of a special blend of plastic and aluminium. When the K-Cup is placed in a Keurig brewer, the brewer punctures the lid and bottom of the K-Cup, and hot water under pressure is forced through the K-Cup, thus brewing the contained coffee right into your waiting cup. A rather ingenious invention, indeed, providing convenient and quick access to individual cups of coffee. Do remember, dear, to recycle your used K-Cups, for we must all do our part for our dear planet.
