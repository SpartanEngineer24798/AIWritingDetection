The Rhine River, one of the major water arteries in Europe, flows through Central and Western Europe. It originates in the Swiss Alps, heads northward through Lake Constance, and traverses the German highlands. Subsequently, it forms a part of the German-French border and later, the German-Belgian border. Meandering through the Netherlands, it culminates into the North Sea. On a world map, you will find this river spanning across the coordinates approximately from 46째 north latitude and 8째 east longitude (Swiss Alps) to 51째 north latitude and 3째 east longitude (North Sea). This river plays a substantial role in terms of facilitating transportation and delineating political boundaries in Europe. Notably, prominent cities along its course include Basel, Strasbourg, Cologne, and Rotterdam.
