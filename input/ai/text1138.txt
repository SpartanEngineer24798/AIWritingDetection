"Auld Lang Syne" is a phrase from Scotland and it means "old long ago". People sometimes call it "days gone by" or "times from long ago". We often sing a song with this name on New Year's Eve when the clock strikes twelve. The song makes us remember our friends from the past and good times we had with them. It's like saying "let's remember all the fun we had in the past and look forward to the new year with happy hearts." But, because it's an old Scottish phrase, it might be a bit hard to understand.
