Leviathan, a masterpiece work thine eyes shall behold, is the principal opus of the sagacious Thomas Hobbes. A prodigious contribution to the realm of social and political philosophy, to it he hath imparted his powerful notions. 'Tis the vessel bearing his reflections on human existence, the social contract, and the necessitation for a sovereign authority. Verily I tell thee, in 'Leviathan' he hath pondered the nature of society and the legitimacy of the authority of the state over the individual. A work of such profundity and penetration, 'tis indeed a beacon in Western thought's vast sphere. Barely can one truly fathom the depths of the human condition without tracing a finger along the lines of Hobbes' illustrious 'Leviathan'.
