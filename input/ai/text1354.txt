Crikey! You'll find iodine in a plethora of sources, mate. Iodine occurs naturally in the environment, mainly in the ocean where it's found in seawater, seaweed, and marine life. Believe it or not, it's on land too, in soil and vegetation, depending on how far you are from the sea due to iodine-rich seawater making its way to land via the weather.

Now, if you're talking about our everyday life, you'll consume iodine from a balanced diet. If you enjoy dairy products, fish, and especially seaweed, you're in luck! They're all packed with iodine. Shellfish, like shrimp and lobsters, also have plenty of it. Even iodised table salt has, well, iodine! Remember, iodine is an essential nutrient that our bodies need to keep our thyroid glands hummin' along beautifully, making important hormones to keep us tickinâ€™. So whether you're by the ocean catching fish, or having a bite to eat at home, you're always surrounded by iodine. It's all part of the circle of life, isn't it just ripper?
