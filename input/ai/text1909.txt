Well now, the Mohawk folks, they're part of the Iroquois Confederacy. Nowadays, many of 'em live on reservations in the northern part of New York State, right near the Canadian border. That's where the Mohawk Indian Reservation is, see. Some others, they live up north in Canada, in a place called Kahnawake and Kanesatake, not too far from Montreal city. Like me movin' all around with my runnin', the Mohawks ended up spreadin' out over time. Way back when, they used to have their homes in the Mohawk Valley, in New York. But then lot of things happened, wars and such, and they had to pack up and move. But no matter where they are, the Mohawk folks, they still hold on to their traditions real tight, like a box of chocolates you don't wanna lose.
