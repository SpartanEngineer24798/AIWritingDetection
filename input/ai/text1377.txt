Crikey, mate! When we talk about D.O. in medicine, we're speaking of Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine. These chaps believe in a more holistic approach. Instead of just treating the symptoms, they look at the whole body, every nook and cranny. Just like we observe behaviours in the animal kingdom to understand a species, a D.O. checks the interactions between all parts of the body to understand a health issue and its impact. They've got the same training as M.D.s (Medical Doctors), but with a little extra in musculoskeletal systems. That's a big word for body's bones, muscles, and nerves. Both D.O.s and M.D.s can prescribe medication and provide surgical treatments. They're equally important as specialized doctors in the wild world of medicine!
