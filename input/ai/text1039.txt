La Palma is not located in Africa. Contrary to common assumptions, it is actually situated in the North Atlantic Ocean. The island is part of the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago, which is positioned to the west of Morocco and Western Sahara in Africa. Despite their geographical proximity to Africa, the Canary Islands are politically and culturally European. While their location gives them an African climate, they have been territories of Spain since the 15th century. Therefore, it's crucial not to mistakenly assign them to the wrong continent. La Palma, known as "La Isla Bonita," is particularly known for its lush vegetation and distinctive starry skies that make it an excellent location for astronomical observations.
