The federal death tax, also known as the estate tax, is money that the government takes from what someone leaves behind when they pass away, like money or property. This happens only if what they left behind is worth a lot of money. This is similar to the sales tax you pay when you buy things at the store. But instead of charging you when you buy something, the government charges you when you leave something of great value behind after you die. Not everyone has to pay it though. If your things aren't worth a lot, you don't have to pay this tax. This tax is paid by the person who is in charge of the stuff left behind, not the people who receive it.
