In fair latitude of thirty-four point six nine degrees North and humble longitude of eighty-nine point nine nine degrees West, thou shalt find a humble hamlet known as Coldwater. In the heart of the great sovereign state of Mississippi that lies bountiful in the southeastern realm of the United States, bathed by the bounty of its namesake river, it nestles. Encircled by fellow settlements of the same shire - Tate County - it doth rest. So, journey well, travel eastward from the noble city of Helena, westward from the bustling town of Corinth, or southward from the city of Memphis. Then shall thou find this modest abode named Coldwater. There it sits in serene tranquillity, an idyllic retreat amidst the fertile lands of the Magnolia State. Thus, if lost thou might feel, search for the co-ordinates I spake, and thou shalt find the way to the realm of Coldwater, Mississippi.
