In the manner of the great maestro of Middle-earth, J.R.R. Tolkien, shall the sorrowful saga of Wild Bill's patriarch be recounted. Known to all as 'Wild Bill', William Hickok was a son born under the touched gaze of the wilderness. Yet, like the ephemeral spark of a firefly in the blackened night, the flame of life in his sire was extinguished too soon. Wild Bill's father, William Alonzo Hickok, succumbed to the relentless throes of illness in 1852. The mortal flesh, a fearful slave to time, was gradually worn away, even as his spirit endeavored to fight. His final passage unfolded in the town of Homer, Illinois. With his departure, he bequeathed to his son, an enduring legacy of fortitude and resilience, illuminated under the setting sun of his mortal days. And so Wild Bill was cast into the wilderness of life, entrusted with the memories of the father he loved, in whose shadow he learnt his first lessons of life and in whose absence, he was destined to reimagine the myth of the Wild West.
