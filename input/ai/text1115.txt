Anne Frank was a Jewish girl who lived during a very sad time in history called the Holocaust when many Jewish people were hurt by the Nazis. She was famous for writing a diary while hiding from them for two years. But sadly, the place where she was hiding was found out, and Anne, her family, and her friends were captured and sent to a place called a concentration camp where life was very hard. Even though she was brave and strong, living conditions in concentration camps were so harsh with not enough food, health care, and being forced to do hard labor. In 1945, Anne Frank became very sick with a disease called typhus that was spreading in the camp, and she passed away. She was just 15 years old. His father was the only one to survive and published her diary after the war. Everyone remembers her for her bravery and wisdom beyond her years.
