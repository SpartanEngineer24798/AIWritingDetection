South Africa, my dear reader, is the epitome of a constitutional democracy, where the baton of power is peacefully passed through the process of elections. The path to leadership, though, isn't a sprint but a marathon. You see, leaders are not directly elected rather they come from political parties. The citizens cast their votes not for an individual but instead for a political party in the National Assembly elections held every 5 years. The party with the greatest number of votes typically forms the government. Now, the leader of the winning party, who is often the party's presidential candidate, becomes the President of South Africa. However, to make them officially the President, they must be elected by the members of the National Assembly, which typically is a formality. This is because the assembly members usually vote in line with the party's decision. As we know, Watson, the political game is all about numbers, strategies, and alliances.
