Well, Watson, a deficiency in adenosine deaminase is not simply a result of poor diet or lack of exposure to certain elements, no, it's far more complex. It all comes down to a mutation in the ADA gene. This gene is necessary for the production of the enzyme, adenosine deaminase. When there is a mutation in this gene, it results in inefficient production or complete absence of this enzyme. This is the root cause of adenosine deaminase deficiency. It's important to note that this deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that primarily affects the immune system. It's usually passed from parents to children through an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. In other words, both parents have to carry the faulty gene and pass it on to cause the disease. So, my dear Watson, itâ€™s our DNA, not our daily habits, that are to blame in this instance.
