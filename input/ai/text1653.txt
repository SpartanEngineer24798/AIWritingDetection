Oh dear, your question is rather akin to asking in which house is Buckingham itself located. Mexico is not within another country; it is a sovereign nation in its own right. It stands proudly as the third largest country in Latin America, only outnumbered by Brazil and Argentina in terms of size. Its location is in the southern portion of North America, within close proximity to the United States. Hence, Mexico is the name of the country, much like Canada, France, or indeed, our own beloved United Kingdom. It possesses its own unique culture, history, and traditions, thereby lending it a distinctive character among the worldâ€™s diverse nations. I do trust this clarifies your query.
