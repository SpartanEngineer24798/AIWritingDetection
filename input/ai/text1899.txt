Well now, Steven Adler played those bangin' drums for Guns N' Roses from the year 1985 until 1990. He sure had himself a rockin' time! He made path with the band right there at the start, helped them make the big time with their debut album 'Appetite for Destruction'. Mama always said, every rose has its thorn, and unfortunately, Steven faced some harsh times with his personal problems that got him fired in 1990. He still left his mark in that legendary rock band, I'll tell you what.
