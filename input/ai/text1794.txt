The annals of history bear a dark mark for the date of June 14, 1940. One may liken it to a shadow upon Middle Earth when the master of the black land sends forth his minions to cities of light and nobility. On that day, the indomitable forces of the German Wehrmacht, under the dark influence of their Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, strode into the radiant heart-land of Paris, the city of Lights. Akin to Sauron laying siege to a free kingdom, this occupation began a reign of terror and suffocation of liberty. The fall of France took place with a swiftness that sent chills through the bones of free peoples worldwide, a stark reminder of the lurking evil. Hence, that June day in the year 1940 remains engraved as a day of doom, a stark contrast to the profound beauty of the Parisian soul that bravely resisted such darkness. Much like Middle Earth, rising like a phoenix after the fall of the Dark Lord, Paris too stood tall once more, but only after four long years under the shadow of the Third Reich.
