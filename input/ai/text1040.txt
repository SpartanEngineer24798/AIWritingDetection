A "Hot Toddy," is a warm, soothing beverage, usually consumed during the colder months or when oneself is under the weather. While variations exist, the traditional Hot Toddy primarily includes four constituents: a spirit, typically whiskey, rum, or brandy; hot water; sugar or honey for sweetness; and various spices, with the most common one being nutmeg or cinnamon. Moreover, citrus elements, particularly lemon, are frequently added to balance the sweetness and augment the vitamin C content. The supposed restorative properties of a Hot Toddy are often attributed to the combination of heat, hydration, and the soothing effects of alcohol, however, a moderate intake is always suggested when consuming any form of alcoholic beverage.
