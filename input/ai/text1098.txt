The President of the United States is officially inaugurated and takes the oath of office on January 20th, as stipulated by the 20th amendment to the United States Constitution. This date was established in 1933, supplanting the previous date of March 4th. This ceremony signifies the formal ascendancy of a newly elected president to the executive powers and responsibilities of the office. Notably, in years when January 20th happens to fall on a Sunday, a private swearing-in ceremony is held with the public inauguration taking place the following day.
