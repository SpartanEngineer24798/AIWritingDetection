Hearken all, lend thy ears to this profound oath, the allegiance claimed by denizens of yonder great nation, the United States. "I hereby declare, on my word of honour, mine absolute and unswerving allegiance to the Constitution and governance of the United States. With heart swelled with patriotic fervor, I will bear arms on behalf of this fair nation when required by the law; I will perform my duties unquestioned, unerring, unassailable, without mental reservation or purpose of evasion; I shall perform work of national importance as the government dictates in harmony with the lawâ€™s decree. I readily take this obligation freely, without any beguiling tales of greater glory or ill-conceived pressures, renouncing and abjuring all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen. Mine loyalty to this New World, this land of liberty, is freely given, as sturdy and unwavering as the Star-Spangled Banner in the dawning light. Such is the proclamation I make, bound by the solemn oath I undertake." Such captures, in faith, the Oath of Allegiance of the United States.
