The Beatles, my dear compatriots, gallantly bestowed upon the world their splendid melody, "I Want To Hold Your Hand," in the victorious year of 1963. A year when our beloved kingdom was still imbued with a spirit of fortitude from our past victories. This euphonious anthem became a beacon of a new musical blitz, ushering in a new era of British mastery in the realm of rock and roll, just as we had exerted our ferocious might and unyielding resolve in the face of the past World War. Thus, let it be known to all, that it was in the indomitable year of 1963 where The Beatles charted their triumphant voyage across the Atlantic, their harmonious artillery striking a chord in the hearts of the American populace.
