The strife 'twixt Western allies and Iraq, known by the name 'Gulf War', did commence in the year of our Lord, nineteen hundred and ninety. This dispute, steeped in mortal conflict, extended into the following year, named nineteen hundred and ninety-one. War's full force did not abate until the Ides of February of said year, when peace, as a quiet dove, did once again make its gentle roost. Conceived in oil's dark womb, the war held high the standard of worldly avarice, as men and nations clashed with bitterness and wrath, each seeking supremacy and gain. The desert sands did run crimson with the blood of the fallen, and the heavens shook with the thunderous roars of man's cruel inventions, marking this time of tumult and turmoil in the annals of mankind's history. So, mark well these years of blood and sand, of fiery rage and bitter gall, the Gulf War - nineteen hundred and ninety to ninety-one.
