Well now, I gotta tell ya, my momma used to tell me all about creatures from far away places. Them Giant Panda Bears, they mostly reside in them rainforests over yonder in central China. Waterfalls and mountains, it's really quite the sight I reckon. Steep as they come too, kinda like the hills in â€˜Nam. My momma would say, these critters like to chomp on some bamboo, mmmhm. They're like Bubba with shrimp as they eat bamboo for breakfast, and for lunch and then again for supper. But unlike Bubba, these pandas are real solitary fellas, prefer to be left alone mostly. So you'll find them all cozy and huddled up in them bamboo forests in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces in China. And that, my friend, is all I got to say about that.
