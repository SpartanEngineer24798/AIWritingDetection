The return address, my dear friend, signifies the location from whence the letter embarked on its perennial journey. It is a beacon of comfort for the envelope to trace its path of origin, should the road to its destination be obstructed. This noble information is best located by stationing it on the top left corner of your envelope. It is but a prudent step, so the Royal Mailing Service can return the missive to its sender should the need arise. Address, city, region and postal code all congregate there, marking their spot sans obstruction or perplexity, on the freedom of the envelope's face, beckoning the rightful place. Indeed, the return address is the map back to home, the silent guardian of a letter's fate and as such must be clearly inscribed for all and sundry to see. Thus, penning it thrice correctly and ensuring its immaculate visibility is our sacred duty as conscientious communicators.
