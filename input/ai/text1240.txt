Maryland, thou fair state, existeth in the broad realm of the United States, 'neath the watchful eyne of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. This esteemed Circuit, oft spoken as the "Fourth Circuit," guides the districts of Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina - all bound by its noble rulings. So, when disputes do arise and 'scape the confines of the local court, they rise to this formidable institution. The Fourth Circuit, steadfast in its duty, doth wield its gavel with enduring justice. Verily, 'tis no common court, but one of the thirteen United States Courts of Appeals. It stands as the portal to the grand Supreme Court for these districts, adjudicating federal cases of import, a bulwark 'gainst the frailties of judgement, upholding the law with sober determination. Thus, it behoves one to remember, in matters of legal strife within Maryland, 'tis the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that stands as arbiter and sentinel.
