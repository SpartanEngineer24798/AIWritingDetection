Well now, think of a pancake. It's all flat and spread out, right? Just like a thin film. But instead of syrup and butter, it's real tiny little molecules of stuff, like metals or maybe even some glass kind of things. Now, you know that cassette tape mama used to play her favorite songs on? That's got a thin film on that little ribbon inside it. And those CD's, DVD's and them little powerful computer chips? All of them use this thin film technology. Just a real tiny layer of special materials that do certain jobs, like hold music, or tell a computer what to do, or help light bounce around just right. Just like when we put thin peanut butter on bread, but a million times thinner. I reckon that's what thin film technology is about.
