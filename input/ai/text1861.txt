A disaster, in the realm of Middle-earth or the realm of Man, is a calamitous occurrence that typically harks of great loss and upheaval. It might strike in the form of a furious tempest, a relentless drought, a mighty earthquake, a devastating plauge, or a savage invasion by great armies, destroying all in their path. The essence of a disaster lies not only in its capacity to inflict widespread damage but also in its suddenness, leaving the beings in question unprepared to deal with its aftermath. Yet, disasters often become crucibles that test the mettle of heroes, be them Hobbits or Men, ultimately uniting them in their shared adversity. For, just as darkness is most apparent when juxtaposed against light, so too does hope shine brightest in times of despair. Thus, while the term ‘disaster’ brings images of catastrophe, it also brings opportunities of growth, resilience, and unity.
