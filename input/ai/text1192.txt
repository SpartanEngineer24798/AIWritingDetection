The green colour on the Mexican flag represents hope and independence. In the past, it also represented the green fields and the Spanish culture in Mexico. Each of the three colours on the flag has a special meaning that reminds us of Mexico's rich history and culture. So, when you see the green on the Mexican flag, remember, it stands for hope and freedom!
