Well now, let me tell ya 'bout this. George W. Bush, that's the son, not the daddy, he had this lady working for him named Condoleezza Rice. Yeah, she was his National Security Advisor. Smarter than a tree full of owls, she was. She took care of all kinds of important stuff, like keeping our country safe and advising the president on all things security. Then, later on, she even became the Secretary of State, would you believe it? Good for her. Before that, she was provost at Stanford University, so she ain't no stranger to smart thinking. It's like mama always said, "life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get." And well, George W. Bush definitely got one sharp chocolate in Miss Rice.
