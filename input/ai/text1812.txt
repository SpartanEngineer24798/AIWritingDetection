Primary medicine, my dear hobbit, is akin to the stewardship of Gandalf in our Middle Earth realms. It is the initial level of healthcare that a member of the Shire, Rohan or even the lands of Mordor seeks when ailments stir their waters. The role of a primary medicine practitioner is equivalent to a trusted sage or a wise wizard, providing persistent, comprehensive and coordinated care in a manner befitting the context of the family and the community. The area of primary medicine is a vast one - from prevention, to diagnosis; from treatment to wellness maintain. You see, my friend, practitioners of primary medicine serve as the first line of defense in healthcare, much like our brave halfling foot soldiers in the War of the Ring. Their realm may less glamorous compared to specialists and surgeons, akin to the humble but essential Shire compared to the grandeur of Rivendell and the majesty of Minas Tirith, but it remains a crucial cornerstone in the fortress of healthcare.
