An entity dire, General Grievous is he, of the galaxy far, far away. A captain vile of the separatist forces, a cyborg of cruel countenance and ill repute. He, with arms a fourfold threat, wields with wicked skill the lightsabers purloined from the Jedi he hath slaughtered. His heart of flesh, the sole remnant of a knightly being of yore, beats in his mechanical breast, serving as a grim testament to all he once was. His countenance, monstrous and awe-striking, strikes fear into those who would stand in opposition to him. Yea, Grievous is the feared scourge of the Republic, relentless in battle as a hound on a foxâ€™s trail. His confederation with Count Dooku, and his pledge to the dark side, mark him as a foe formidable in the tale of the Star Wars. Virulent in vendetta, voracious in vengeance, verily he stands as a villain in this interstellar play.
