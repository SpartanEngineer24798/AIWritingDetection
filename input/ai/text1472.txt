In the realm of international football, my dear Watson, it is indeed the Spanish-speaking countries of Argentina, Spain, and Uruguay that boast the most FIFA World Cup victories. The vigorous Argentina has triumphantly clasped the cup twice, once in 1978 and again in 1986. Spain, with its tactical finesse, tasted victory in 2010. Additionally, the plucky Uruguay emerged triumphant in the early days of the tournament, winning in 1930 and 1950. Thus, with two titles each, these nations jointly hold the highest number of victories among Spanish-speaking territories. Yet, Brazil, a Portuguese-speaking country, holds the record overall with a total of 5 World Cup wins. Your interest in football history is rather intriguing, Watson.
