A small bowel obstruction is like a blockage in your tummy's tubes, like when a pipe gets blocked in your house. This could happen because of different reasons. Sometimes, the muscles that help push the food down stop working right, just like how a toy car stops moving if the batteries die. Sometimes, it's because of something that's grown inside like scar tissue, which is like having chewed gum stuck inside the tube. Sometimes, it's because a bit of the tummy gets folded over, like when your sock gets a twist and you can't put your foot in. All these things stop the food from moving down like it should, and it gets stuck, causing pain and other problems.
