Verily, 'tis a tale of modern marvels! In a time not unlike our own, the year of 2006, did three noble gentlemen of vision, by names Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone, and Evan Williams, join hands and minds to create a realm most digital - a platform named Twitter. In its simplicity, a complex tapestry of voices - limited to a mere hundred and forty characters in its earliest form. This structure was alter'd to permit two hundred and eighty, accommodating an ever-expanding chorus of voices. Dorsey, worthy of note, was the first to wield this new tool; "just setting up my twttr", his inaugural missive. This realm, this Twitter, enabled all folk - peasants to princes - to share their thoughts and news most immediately. Verily, a worthy testament to man's innovation - a creation of Dorsey, Stone, and Williams. Hail them, the founders of Twitter!
