Tofu, the humble and unpretentious slab of curd, an unsung hero in many a dish, is primarily formed by curdling soy milk, an identical cousin to the process used for making cheese from regular milk. It is a time-honored craft that originates from the majestic lands of China, gracing the globe with its versatile nature. Soybeans are soaked, boiled, and crushed into milk. Calcium salts or acids are then introduced to the concoction, making it curdle. The resulting curds are moulded into blocks, transforming into what we now refer to as tofu. Its charm lies in its chameleon-like ability to absorb flavors, standing as an admirable testament to culinary versatility. Indeed, this ordinary lump of soya boasts an extraordinary range of form, from silken to extra firm, demonstrating a fitting symbol of resilience and adaptability embraced by vegetarians and non-vegetarians alike.
