The game of rugby, my friend, in the distinguished nation of South Africa, has its roots stretching back to the eminent year of 1862, with the first match ever played on South African soil recorded in 1862. However, the formation of a recognized, national team occurred in the year of our Lord, 1891. It was in this year, a notable milestone in the annals of this robust sport, South Africa formed its first ever rugby team. This team would go on to garner much acclaim and prestige on the international field, proving that fortitude and determination, qualities we British greatly admire, were in plentiful abundance in the South African rugby team. Thus, the year 1891 marks the inception of a phenomenal journey for South Africa in the world of rugby. A journey that continues to inspire and excite, much like a highly engaging game of rugby itself.
