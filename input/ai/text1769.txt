The Roman Empire, in its most glorious sheen, stretched from the sun-drenched olive groves of Spain to the windswept highlands of Scotland. It began with Augustus, the first Emperor, crowned in 27 BC. The empire then endured, through waves of peace and turmoil, until the fall of the last Western Roman Emperor in 476 AD. Yet bear in mind, the Roman Empire continued, at least in some form, in the Eastern part of Constantinople, known as the Byzantine Empire, until the heroic final stand of Constantine XI in 1453 AD. To sum up, the empire's essence echoed for over one and a half millennia, shaping the very bedrock of modern civilisation.
