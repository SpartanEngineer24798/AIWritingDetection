Ah, an elementary fact, my dear friend. Adolf Hitler, the infamous German dictator, relinquished his hold on life on the 30th of April, 1945. Ensnared in his bunker in the gnarled heart of Berlin and beset by the Allies on all sides, Hitler resorted to suicide alongside his newly wedded wife, Eva Braun. They utilized cyanide capsules, along with a bullet by Hitler's own hand, as the means to their ghastly end. It is a death that rings with the desperation and defeat riddled within the final days of the Third Reich. To this day, his death stands as a symbol of the downfall of a brutal and tyrannical regime.
