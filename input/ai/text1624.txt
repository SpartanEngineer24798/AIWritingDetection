In the sport of hockey, high sticking refers to an infraction committed when a player raises their stick above the normal height of their opponents' shoulders, and it makes contact with an opposing player. It is deemed unsafe and potentially harmful, and thus, it is not allowed. The penalty varies depending on the severity of the action. If a player due to high sticking causes injury to an opponent, a more serious consequence is encountered, often resulting in the removal of the offending player from the game for a certain period. One should strive for a fair and honourable contest, thus the implementation of such rules is an essential measure.
