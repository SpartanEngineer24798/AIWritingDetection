In fair South Africa, where we lay our scene, many tongues echo forth across the land. Verily, they number eleven in totality, the largest share of speech claimed by the Zulu, followed close by Xhosa, then Afrikaans, holding rife with traces of Dutch. English, although so widely understood, ranks but only fifth, 'neath Pedi and Twana. Sohtho, both Northern and Southern, hold court, with Tsonga, Swati, and the melodious Venda completing this illustrious assembly. Thus, in its linguistic garb doth South Africa shine, a spectrum fair and wide as the rainbows that grace its splendid skies. Forsooth, it's a tapestry woven with threads from diverse corners of the world.
