According to the data deduced from my recent observations, Apple, the multinational technology titan, operates 511 retail stores across 25 countries. Keep in mind, my dear Watson, this information may alter as Apple is renowned for its continual global expansion. Should you require the most recent data, I recommend a quick visit to Apple's official website or perhaps their Wiki page. The company keeps these platforms well updated, reflecting their commitment to transparency and customer service.
