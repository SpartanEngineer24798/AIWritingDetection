A redshirt freshman football player is a player who, in their first year of college, practices with the team but does not play in the official games. By doing this, they can extend their 4-year eligibility to play sports in college to 5 years. They get to learn from the team, practice, and improve their skills without using up one of their eligibility years. They're called "redshirt" because they usually wear a different color jersey, often red, during practices to show they're not playing in games. So, a "redshirt freshman" is in their second year of college but it's their first year playing in official games.
