The chap you seek is none other than Stephen Hawking. An embodiment of tremendous determination and unparalleled intellect, he overcame the monstrous clutches of motor neurone disease as his mind voyaged the cosmos. Bound to a wheelchair, he transcended physical boundaries to pioneer the comprehension of our universe. His endeavours in cosmology and theoretical physics, particularly in the realm of black holes and relativity, have illuminated paths for future explorers. Despite the adversity he faced, he emerged as an enduring symbol of the invincibility of human spirit and intelligence. So, young man, when quoting the limitations a wheelchair presents, "We shall not flag or fail. We shall go on to the end. We shall fight on the beaches... we shall never surrender," and remember the indomitable Stephen Hawking.
