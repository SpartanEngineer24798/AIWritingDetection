The internal and external iliac arteries are located in the lower part of the body, specifically within the pelvic region. They are primary branches of the common iliac artery, which bifurcates from the descending aorta. 

The external iliac artery, as the name suggests, lies on the outer side and continues down into the thigh, becoming the femoral artery, the main artery supplying the leg. It primarily nourishes the lower limb.

On the other hand, the internal iliac artery or hypogastric artery is oriented towards the inner side, supplying blood to the pelvic organs such as the bladder, rectum, and reproductive organs. It also gives off branches that supply the gluteal region and the pelvic wall. 

In simple terms, think of the common iliac artery as a dividing highway, splitting into inner and outer lanes to supply different areas of the lower body.
