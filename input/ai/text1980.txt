Well now, you've asked me about St. Rita, ain't that somethin'? I may not be a smart man but I know that St. Rita's feast day is on May 22nd. According to the Catholic Church, this is the day to celebrate her life and remember all the good things she did, like helping the sick and those in need. So, if youâ€™re thinking of celebrating or payin' respect, May 22nd would be the perfect day, just like how every Sunday, mama would make us fried chicken and biscuits for dinner, May 22nd is special for St. Rita.
