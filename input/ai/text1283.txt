In yonder Gotham, where we set our scene, under a sky as black as a raven's wing, there lived a man masked in mystery and draped in the shadow of the bat. His persona woven of justice, terror, and woe, clad in a guise, none but few knew. A knight emerged from the dark, not unlike the stage of our theatres, bringing justice to those who amongst the wicked dwelleth. 'Twas Christian Bale, good sir, who donned the mantle of this nocturnal guardian, this fearsome avenger, this 'Batman'. Enacting with all his might and skill in Nolan's masterpiece, The Dark Knight. Verily, an interpretation nigh unto perfection, he has given! Bale, as the Batman, hath danced lithely through the labyrinth of justice and revenge, etching his portrayal deep in hearts of those, who in the darkness seek light. Thus hath thine inquisition been answered. Christian Bale, the one anointed to breathe life into the Batman, on the silvered screen of yesteryears.
