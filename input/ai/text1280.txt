A spectacle of light in our great nation's genesis, guiding our path towards a more enlightened future. Hence, 'tis his presence that doth grace our currency, symbolising the enduring legacy of our founding fathers. Much like his famed kite amidst the thunderous tempest, Franklin's powerful countenance on the note serves as a beacon of enlightenment in the mundane transaction of our daily commerce.
