The highest concentration of Jewish population resides in two global regions: North America and Middle East. In North America, the United States hosts the largest Jewish community outside Israel, with significant populations particularly in New York, California, and Florida. In the Middle East, the majority of the Jewish population resides in Israel, primarily in cities such as Jerusalem, Tel Aviv-Yafo, and Haifa. Additionally, there are noteworthy Jewish communities in European countries like France and the United Kingdom, and smaller communities spread out across the world from Australia to Latin America. The demographic patterns of these communities are shaped by historical events, including migration, persecution and the establishment of the state of Israel. It should be stressed that the Jewish Diaspora is quite diverse; we can see differences in Jewish religious affiliations, cultural practices, languages used, and engagement with Israel across different countries and communities.
