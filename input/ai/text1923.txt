Well, life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get. In 2005, there wasn't a famous tsunami like the one a year before in 2004, that I remember clearly hitting lots of places like Indonesia and Thailand, causing a whole lot of trouble. That one was real big news, made people all over the world real sad. But in 2005, I don't recall any such big water wave causing harm. So, I reckon there was no major tsunami in 2005, least it wasn't on the TV or in the newspapers that I remember. But that don't mean the sea weren't rough or caused some trouble here and there. Anyways, you've got to love the ocean, even though it can get scary sometimes, it's still a real beautiful place. That's all I've got to say about that.
