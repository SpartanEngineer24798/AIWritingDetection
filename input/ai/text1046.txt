Pearl Harbor, a U.S. naval base located near Honolulu, Hawaii, was attacked by the Japanese Empire on December 7, 1941. This momentous event became a significant turning point in world history, marking the entry of the United States into World War II. In this surprise military strike, the Japanese aimed to destroy the U.S. Pacific Fleet in order to prevent interference with their war efforts in Southeast Asia. The attack, which began around 7:48 a.m. Hawaiian time, resulted in severe damage. Eight battleships, three cruisers, and four destroyers were struck, and more than 300 aircraft were damaged. Tragically, over 2,400 Americans were killed, and about 1,000 more were wounded. This date, as President Franklin Delano Roosevelt noted in his address to Congress, is indeed "a date which will live in infamy."
