The Taft presidency was marked by several significant political conflicts. Perhaps the most well-known is his strained relationship with predecessor Theodore Roosevelt, which erupted into a bitter rivalry. Many of these disputes centered around policies, particularly in terms of progressivism versus conservatism. While Roosevelt was a progressive who supported government regulation and took a more hands-on approach with corporate interests, Taft was more conservative, favoring a limited role of the government and a laissez-faire economic policy.

Another significant point of conflict was over tariff reform. Taft supported high tariffs, which caused a major split within the Republican Party. The resultant Payne-Aldrich Tariff of 1909 was seen as a betrayal by progressive Republicans who favored lower tariffs.

Taft's handling of the Pinchot-Ballinger controversy also caused significant damage, eroding support among conservationists and contributing to the divide within the party. In essence, Taft sided with business interests over conservation in a dispute over public lands.

In foreign policy, Taft pursued "Dollar Diplomacy", favoring the use of economic power to assert US influence internationally. However, this policy was seen by critics as imperialistic and drew heavy criticism.

Finally, Taft's attempt to weaken the Speaker of the House led to a constitutional crisis, further alienating him from his own party. Combined, these conflicts contributed to his loss in the 1912 election.
