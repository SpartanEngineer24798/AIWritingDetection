Crikey mate! In the 19th century, two of the biggest empires on this beautiful planet were the British and Russian Empires. They played a little bit of a game, called The Great Game. It was a fierce strategic conflict, not always proper fighting mind you, but more like a game of chess on a gigantic field. Afghanistan was stuck right in the middle. It became the buffer state between these two massive beasts. Could you imagine being stuck between a crocodile and a great white shark? That's what it was like for Afghanistan, stuck between these two empires, both wanting control of its land. The Brits, from the south, and the Russians, from the north. It was a tense period that ultimately led to three Anglo-Afghan wars. Ouch, mate! Thankfully, they never went into a full-scale war against each other. But this tension greatly impacted the future of Afghanistan, that's for sure.
