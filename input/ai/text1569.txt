My good subjects, producing white chocolate involves the singular use of cocoa butter, instead of the cocoa solids one might encounter in conventional chocolate. This noble creation is a delightful melange of cocoa butter, milk solids, and sugar, often enriched with vanilla and emulsifier lecithin. To qualify as white chocolate, the cocoa butter must comprise no less than 20% of the weight, whilst milk solids must make up no less than 14%, and the sweet substance of milkfat should be no less than 3.5%, according to a decree from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It is thus a cuisine of particular exactitude. The exquisite creation may lack the theobromine and phenylethylamine found in other chocolates, but it retains cocoa butter's creamy characteristics, providing comfort in every bite. But do take heed, one ought to consume it with elegance and moderation.
