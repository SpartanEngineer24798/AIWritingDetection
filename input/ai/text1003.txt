Respiration in plants involves the uptake of oxygen and the release of carbon dioxide. This process is regulated by a feedback mechanism known as homeostasis. During daylight hours, when photosynthesis occurs, plants consume carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. However, during the night, or in the absence of light, photosynthesis ceases, and respiration prevails, leading to the consumption of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide. 

This feedback mechanism allows the plant to balance its gas exchange, ensuring it does not deplete its surroundings of either gas. The higher the concentration of carbon dioxide, the faster the rate of photosynthesis until the point is reached where a further increase has no effect. Conversely, if the oxygen concentration rises too high, this slows the plant's rate of respiration. 

The feedback mechanisms within plant respiration and photosynthesis thus ensure a balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration, essential for plant health and the overall ecological balance. These mechanisms highlight the interconnectedness of plant biochemical processes and their adaptability to environmental conditions.
