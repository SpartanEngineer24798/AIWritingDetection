Deliverables are things or tasks that you promise to give or finish for someone else. Think of it like when you promise your teacher to finish your homework by tomorrow. The finished homework you give back is a deliverable. It can also be like when you make a beautiful hand-made card for your friend's birthday. The card you give is a deliverable. In fact, any item or task you promise to give or do for someone else and then deliver it or do it is a deliverable. It's like keeping your promise to give something or do something and then doing it really well.
