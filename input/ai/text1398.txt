Crikey, mate! Your question is a bit tricky, like tryin' to wrangle a saltie in the outback! You're asking for the name of a late Major League professor, but that's not quite clear, you see? Major League usually refers to professional baseball in the United States, but there's no "Major League" for professors. If you could give me a bit more information, I'd be happy as a kangaroo in springtime to help you out!
