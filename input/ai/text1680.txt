The date of that profound tragedy, the assault upon Pearl Harbor, the egregious act that pulled the United States into the Second World War, was December 7, 1941. A horrifying day, indubitably, marked by the unwarranted destruction and loss of innocent lives. “A date which will live in infamy,” as proclaimed by President Roosevelt. It has since then, served as a reminder of the catastrophic potential of war and the indomitable spirit of a nation rallying in the face of adversity.
