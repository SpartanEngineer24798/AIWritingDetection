Crikey! On most US airlines, the cabin pressure is set to mimic the atmosphere at about 6,000 - 8,000 feet above sea level. It's not quite like being on the ground, mate, but it's a lot more comfortable than the atmospheric pressure at the cruising altitude of a plane, which can be as high as 35,000 feet. Adjustments to cabin pressure are essential for your comfort and well-being while you're in the sky. Now, if the cabin pressure were much lower, oxygen levels would drop too, causing altitude sickness. But airlines know what they're doing and keep the pressure just right so we can all enjoy our journey. So on your next flight, relax and don't worry about the cabin pressure, mate! Magnificent, isn't it?
