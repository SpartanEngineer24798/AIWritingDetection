As Winston Churchill said, "There is something about the outside of a horse that is good for the inside of a man." Similarly, there is something about Disney's Magic Kingdom that is good for the heart of a child and an adult alike. It is more than an amusement park, it is an embrace of the extraordinary that exists within the commonplace, a celebration of the magic of storytelling, and the resilience of the human spirit.
