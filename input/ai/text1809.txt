A sonic boom is the evidence of an object, usually an aircraft or other vehicle, dashing through the atmosphere at a speed greater than that of sound. This accelerative act disrupts the natural tranquility of the air, creating pressure waves similar to the waves formed by a rock hurled into a still pond. These pressure waves, collated together, form a shock wave that stretches from the speeding object, slicing the air with aplomb and propagating outwards in a cone. The sounds ensuing from these shock waves - described usually as a loud crack or a thunderous clap - is what we perceive as a sonic boom. It is the audible expression of the displacement of air that has been overtaken by an object moving faster than sound itself. It's like ripples on the canvas of the sky, a resonance born out of mighty speed and echoing power.
