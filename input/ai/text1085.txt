Airbags are designed to deploy during significant frontal and side collisions typically at a crash speed of about 16 to 25 km/h (10 to 16 mph) or above. They get triggered when there's a rapid deceleration, as sensed by the accelerometer present in the vehicle. The sensor sends a signal to the airbag control unit (ACU), which then activates the airbag inflator. The inflator ignites a chemical propellant, generating gas that fills up the airbag, causing it to deploy rapidly, typically within 30 to 50 milliseconds of the collision. Moreover, sophisticated ACU algorithms also consider factors such as crash severity, occupant size, and seating position to decide whether to deploy the airbags or not. Thus, airbags are not expected to deploy in minor crashes or during hard braking, as they demand a substantial impact. Lastly, remember not all airbags in a car deploy simultaneously; it will depend on the type and angle of impact. It is vital to always use seat belts, as airbags are supplemental restraints and work best in combination with seat belts.
