G'day mate! A league when we're talkin' about the sea, isn't a group of sea creatures getting together for a game. No, it's actually a term used to measure distance. Historically, a sea league is how far a person could see from the deck of a ship looking out towards the horizon. Technically speaking, one league is roughly 3.45 miles or 5.56 kilometers. However, it can differ depending on historical context and country. Fun fact though, when you hear about Jules Verne's novel '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,' it's not about depth, it's about distance travelled. I reckon, the sea's mystery becomes even greater when viewed through the lens of such a grand scale. Crikey, it's a big, amazing world out there!
