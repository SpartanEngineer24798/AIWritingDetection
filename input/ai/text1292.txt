Good morrow. Alas, tis true. The mortal soul of yon gentleman, Jack LaLanne, hath bid adieu to this world and took celestial flight. Mark the day, 'twas the chill morn of the twenty-third day in the month of January, in the year of our lord, two thousand and eleven. Admired greatly he was, for his tireless efforts to uplift the health and vigour of his fellow beings. As vivid as a comet, yet, like all that's mortal, was fated to run his course. Dost thou question the certainty of life? Look upon Jack LaLanne's demise and wonder. Forsooth, regardless of all we achieve and accumulate, the pall of death spares none. So it was, and shall forever be. May his soul rest in peace and his legend continue to thrive in the hearts of all. Fare thee well, good sir.
