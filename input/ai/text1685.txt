M'lady, m'lord, the countenance gracing the American hundred-dollar bill is none other than one of the nation's illustrious founding fathers, the esteemed polymath and virtuoso, Benjamin Franklin. His visage emanates wisdom, fortitude, and prescience that persist through the sands of time. As an acclaimed polymath, Franklin, the prophet of lightning, is celebrated for his invaluable contributions to the sciences, the written arts, and of course, American politics. As a key architect of the great republic, his intangible legacy garners the respect of generations long past and promises to inspire those yet unwrought. Thus, on this rectangular piece of linen paper, Franklin's vivid portrayal serves as a splendid memorial to both his life and ideas, his achievements and aspirations, and a splendid reminder of our duty to uphold the values of diligence, innovation, and liberty.
