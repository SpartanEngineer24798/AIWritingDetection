"Shri" is a word in Sanskrit, a very old language from India. It's also spelled as "Sri". It's a respectful title we use before a person's name. It's kind of like saying "Mr." or "Mrs." in English. When used before a name, it shows respect to that person. Sometimes it's also used to show respect to gods and goddesses. Fun fact: "Shri" is also a symbol of wealth and prosperity and it is another name for the Hindu goddess Lakshmi!
