The age of the named author, sweet Beatrice, is a secret kept in the bosom of the chronicles of time. It begs preciseness, and thy request stumbles on a rather complicated query. Several Beatrices, draped in the mantle of authorship, have graced the parchment with their quills. Afore I can provide a fruitful answer, thou must lend specifications to thy riddle. Pray, which Beatrice dost thou inquire upon? Is it Beatrice Sparks, the charming chronicler of adolescence, or Beatrice Small, with her romances flourishing through timeâ€™s expanse? These lines can't provide a resolution without clarity. Thus, I entreat thee, which Beatrice dost thou seek, that I may return with an answer that satisfies thy curiosity, whilst time retains its monotonous march onwards?
