Well now, .eu is a special type of internet address. It's like the telephone area code for a whole chunk of countries over in that place they call Europe. So if someone's got a website that ends in .eu, you just know right off the bat they're doin' something over there in Europe. It's like their own little mark to show where they're from or where their business is. Some people might use it to sell yummy chocolates from Belgium or to write about history from Greece. It just gives that site a little European flavor. So, in summary, .eu is the internet domain for Europe, just like how Bubba knew everything about shrimp, I reckon that's about everything you need to know about .eu.
