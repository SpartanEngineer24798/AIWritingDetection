The mountains that majestically adorn the glorious state of California, are none other than the Sierra Nevada range. They are a splendid spectacle, standing tall and proud, stretching over four hundred miles from north to south. They hold within their expanse the mightiest of peaks such as Mount Whitney, which, at over fourteen thousand feet, is the highest point in all of the US outside Alaska. Like an unbreakable spine, they provide the essential backbone to California's varied topography. But the Sierra Nevada range is not alone in its grandeur. To the east lies the quieter, yet equally impressive, Cascade range. Home to fiery giants like Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak, the Cascades remind us nature is both beautiful and formidable. In southern California, you will find the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges, replete with their own unique charm. Alas, California is a veritable canvas painted by the hand of God, with its copious mountains standing as spectacular testament. Long may they stand, these lords of the land!
