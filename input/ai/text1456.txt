Circumpolar constellations, dear Watson, are those extraordinary clusters of stars that remain perpetually visible in the night sky to an observer at a particular latitude. Unlike other constellations that rise and set, these do not. As the Earth rotates on its axis, these constellations appear to move in a circle around either the North or South Pole, hence the term "circumpolar‚Äù. Their visibility, my dear Watson, entirely depends on the observer's latitude. The further one goes towards the poles, the more constellations become circumpolar. For us in the northern hemisphere, constellations such as Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, and Cassiopeia are circumpolar. Fascinating, isn't it?
