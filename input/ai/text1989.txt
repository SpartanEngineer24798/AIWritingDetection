Well now, V would usually refer to a specific event, show, or thing. Without knowing those details, I can't rightly say when V starts. But I can tell you a thing or two about waiting - it's like my momma always said, "patience is a virtue, Forrest." You gotta wait a little while, usually, for something good to come along. Whether it's a shrimp boat, a box of chocolates, or the start of V, good things come to those who wait. Ain't that the truth.
