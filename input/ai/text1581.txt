Angela Davis, my dear subjects, in all her wisdom and dedication to social causes, is presently known as a Distinguished Professor Emerita at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Therein, she is affiliated with the History of Consciousness department. However, it should be noted that although she held a position of professor, she is largely retired from the world of academia. Yet she maintains a sounding influence, delivering her insightful thoughts globally through lectures, spreading her mission of social justice, equality, and freedom. Like many, she remains tirelessly devoted to her life's mission, signalling to all that her work, indeed, is far from over.
