Verily, MPEG4 AVC, otherwise known as Advanced Video Coding, is an encoding scheme for digital video. This implements part 10 of the MPEG-4 standard, which aims for utmost efficiency in video compression. Whilst SP/ASP, referring to Simple Profile and Advanced Simple Profile, are parts of the MPEG-4 Part 2 standard. They provide advanced technologies to allow streaming and broadcasting over the networks of chariots traversing the ether. To differentiate, the AVC provides higher compression efficiency and is better suited for network transmission wirelessly, whilst SP/ASP are optimized for low-bandwidth and less computing-intensive requirements. Art thou grasping my speech henceforth?

In simpler parlance, MPEG4 AVC is the upgrade to SP/ASP, enabling clearer moving images for thy eyes to consume with lessened bandwidth. Thus, prithee heed this, for in the land of zeros and ones, these are powerful tools used by the conjurers of moving pictures. They use these elusive codes and ciphers to cast forth their vision unto screens, both small and large, across the realm. And so, the magicians continue their work, creating for thee the illusions of life in the spirit of marks upon a page.
