Well now, I ain't no fancy economist, but I've heard folks sayin' that in the United States, we spend quite a darn lot on health care for each person. Accordin' to some numbers I saw, we're talkin' about $11,000 or thereabouts for each person, each year. Now, that's a whole lot of chocolates. Some think it's just too expensive, others reckon it's needed for good health care. The way I see it, health is somethin' real important. Like mommy always said, "Forrest, you've got to look after your body. It's the only one you've got."
