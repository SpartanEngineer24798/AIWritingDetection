In the Harry Potter movies, the character of Dumbledore was played by two different actors. For the first two films, 'Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone' and 'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets', Richard Harris was Dumbledore. He did a great job but sadly, he passed away. After Richard Harris, Michael Gambon took over from the third film, 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' and he continued to play Dumbledore until the end of the series. Both of them were really good and brought the character to life in their own special way.
