Renaissance English, my dear Watson, refers to the form of the English language used during the Renaissance period, which spanned from approximately the late 15th to the early 17th century. It represents a transitional phase in the overall evolution of the English language, labeled as Early Modern English, a period succeeding Middle English and preceding Late Modern English. This was the time when William Shakespeare made indelible contributions to English literature. Chaucer's blending of vernacular and courtly speech paved the way for linguistic change, while the introduction of the printing press by William Caxton in the late 15th century standardised the language further. ‘Thou’ and ‘thee’ were prevalent forms of address, verb endings like ‘est’ and ‘eth’ were common. The Great Vowel Shift, a major change in the pronunciation of the English language, also took place during the Renaissance. So, Renaissance English, to put it succinctly, was a bridge between the old and new, an arresting period in the history of the English language, shaping it into what we speak today.
