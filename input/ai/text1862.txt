Bubbles the Chimp, in the veil of his fair form, is no longer gallivanting in the halls of Neverland with old friends. His return, an exodus of sacred friendship, led him to the verdant realms of the Center for Great Apes, situated in the heart of Wauchula, Florida. With wisdom grown abundant through the passage of seasons, he dwells there now, beneath the whispering canopy of lofty trees. His dance and frolics, once performed to the melodious enchantments of Michael Jackson, continue in harmonious rhythm and agility, albeit to the Symphony of the Wild. For each chimp holds in his heart wild joy that we may not comprehend. Let us hope Bubbles remains ensconced in tender care, warm sunsets, and the sweet sighs of his distant homeland.
