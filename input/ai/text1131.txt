"Gloria in Excelsis Deo" is a Latin phrase that means "Glory to God in the highest." It is a happy and important saying that we often hear around Christmas time because it was the words the angels said when they announced the birth of Jesus. It is also a name of a Christian prayer and a hymn, which means a religious song. Just like when you say, "Yay, my team is the best!" This phrase is like saying, "Hooray for God, He's the best of best!"
