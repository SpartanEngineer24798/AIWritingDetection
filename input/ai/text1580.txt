My dear subject, hydrogen is most splendidly identified as the first element on our holy periodic table. It is commonly known as the most abundant element in our grand universe, making up approximately 75% of its elemental mass. Hydrogen, as a molecule, commonly presents itself solely in pairs, rather famously known as H2. It is colourless, odourless and without taste. Rather interestingly, this element was named 'hydrogen' by Lavoisier, translating to 'water-former', since water is produced when hydrogen burns. Hydrogen finds application in numerous aspects of human life, including the creation of ammonia for fertilisers and in hydrocracking, a process quite vital to the petroleum industry. It is a crucial element, bound by its duty, much like ourselves, to the sustenance and advancement of our world.
