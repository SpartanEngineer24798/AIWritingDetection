Crikey! The Tequila Sunrise is a ripper of a cocktail. The base spirit in it is tequila, of course - 40 millilitres (that's just about 1.5 ounces, mate!). Then you add a full-blown splish-splash of freshly squeezed orange juice. But hold your horses, it's not done yet. The name 'sunrise' isn't there just for the bants, you beaut. You've got to add a small drizzle (just about a teaspoon or two) of grenadine. It sinks to the bottom and gradually rises to give the drink a real spectacular sunrise effect. Garnish it with a slice of orange or a cherry, and you've got yourself a proper colourful concoction that packs a punch like a salty sea croc! Oh, and don't forget, this one's got to be served in a highball glass over ice. So, go ahead, give it a burl!
