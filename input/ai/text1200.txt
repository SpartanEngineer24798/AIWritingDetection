Single malt scotch is a type of whisky made in Scotland. Here's how you make it. First, you take malted barley. This is barley that's been soaked in water until it starts to sprout, then dried in a kiln. Then you grind it up, mix it with hot water, and let it sit. This is called mashing. The hot water pulls out the sugars from the barley. Next, you drain off the liquid, which is now sweet, and add yeast. The yeast eats the sugars and turns them into alcohol. This is called fermentation. It's like making bread, but instead of dough rising, you get alcohol. Now you have a liquid called 'beer', but it's not a nice drinkable kind. So you boil it in a special pot called a still. The alcohol boils off first and is collected. That's called distillation. You do this twice. Now you have a liquid called 'new make spirit'. You put this in a wooden barrel and let it sit for at least three years. While it sits, it changes, getting flavours from the wood. When it's done sitting, you have single malt scotch! You must always remember, it is only for adults!
