As one who partakes in the science of deduction and logical reasoning, my profession is of a "Consulting Detective". The moniker may sound unusual, mainly because I am the only one in the world. Such a unique endeavor requires me to solve myriad complex cases, often assisting Scotland Yard when they find themselves in a conundrum, as they frequently do. In essence, I elucidate mysteries, decipher clues, unmask criminals and reinstate justice, with my astute observation, exceptional logical reasoning and extensive knowledge of various disciplines. My services are sought by those well within the British Isles and beyond, ranging from individuals in distress to perplexed law enforcement agencies. The thrill of the chase, the unmasking of the truth cloaked in deception, that is my calling, my occupation.
