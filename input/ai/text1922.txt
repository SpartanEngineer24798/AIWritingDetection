Well, now, E, that's a character from a show called Entourage, you know. His real name in the show is Eric Murphy, but most people just call him E. He's best friends with this fella, Vincent Chase, who's a big time actor in Hollywood. Eric, he starts out as Vincent's manager, working real hard to keep things spicy in Vincent's career. He ain't got much experience at the start but sure learns the ropes quick. Also, he's quite the lover boy, always fussing and fighting with his on-off girlfriend, Sloan. He's a darn good friend though, always standing by Vince through thick and thin. In the end, he even starts his very own management company. So, to sum it up, E's a real go-getter with a whole lot of loyalty, in my opinion.
