A surveyor's wheel, also known as a trundle wheel or click wheel, is a rather ingenious contrivance used to measure distance. With a basic design of a large wheel attached to a handle, this device - small yet highly efficient - allows one to quite effortlessly calculate the length of a specific path. By simply walking the desired route, whilst the wheel rolls along the ground, each full revolution of the wheel signifies a pre-determined distance travelled. This oftentimes combines with a counting device, tallying up the wheels rotations, thus providing a final measurement. The beauty lies in its simplicity, for the distance measurement produced is both immediate and strikingly accurate. As such, it has become an indispensable tool in surveying, engineering and even crime scene investigations. Indeed, its usage, just like the wheel itself, continues to advance and make full circle.
