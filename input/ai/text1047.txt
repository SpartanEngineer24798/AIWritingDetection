Replete with themes of endurance, corruption, redemption, and hope, Andy maintains his innocence, using his financial prowess to ingratiate himself with the corrupt prison authorities while slowly digging an escape tunnel over the course of 19 years hidden behind a poster in his cell. Meanwhile, Red, our narrator, confronts his guilt and longs for redemption, earning parole only after he finds himself reformed. The story culminates in a dramatic reveal of Andy's escape, ultimately leading to the exposure of the prison's corruption.
