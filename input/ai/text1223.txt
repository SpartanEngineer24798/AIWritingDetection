Verily, the core constituent of these concoctions dubbed vaccines, yclept for their vigilant virtues to guard our well-being, is an element known as an "antigen". This fragment is oft obtained from the very bane it is fated to battle: a weakened or terminated organism, or parts thereof, that hath been responsible for the illness. This doth include bacteria or viruses, or their toxins. These brave antigens, by their presence, bid our body's sentinels, the immune system, to besiege them and thus learn and remember their forms, to better prepare for future invasions of the same enemy. And hence, when the true plague doth enter the body, the immune system, knowing well its foe, can vanquish them swiftly and soundly. These vaccines therefore, are not but training grounds, where our body doth gain knowledge and prowess to fend off future affronts. They are indeed the watchmen of our mortal being, aiding in the preservation of our precious health.
