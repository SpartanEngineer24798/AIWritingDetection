Marry, fair question thou dost ask. A ham station, when engaged in genial conversation with another, must identify itself every ten score minutes by its FCC-assigned call sign. This, noble inquirer, is vital to maintaineth propriety and lawfulness. Should there be an interruption within this time frame, the operator bears the duty of identifying the station at the end of the engagement. But let no man forget, prithee identify thy station also at the beginning of transmission or exchange, whilst conversing in the English tongue, or other wise knoweth languages. Perchance thou taketh a long pause betwixt transmissions, then thou needest not identify thyself during said pause. In knowing this, may thou converse freely with assurance and responsibility.
