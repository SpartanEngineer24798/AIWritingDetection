Methinks the the practice of classifying human races commenced in the late 18th century. 'Twas the eminent Carl Linnaeus, in his notable "Systema Naturae" (published in 1735), who first began to categorize humans into varieties based on continental regions. Thereafter, strung forth Johann Friedrich Blumenbach's influential work, "On the Natural Varieties of Mankind" (published in 1775). His classification, later revered as the scientific model, thrust into being five distinct races based on physical characteristics and geographic origin, to wit, the Caucasoid, Mongoloid, Ethiopian, American, and Malay. Alas, such classifications became the bedrock of scientific racism, viewed as bunkum in current times. Modern geneticists declare, race has no taxonomic significance; all humans belong to the same homogenous species. Much ado about nothing, truly, yet these taxonomies have had a profound impact on social strata over the centuries. Thus, remember, good friends, we are all but Homo sapiens, under heaven's eye. The rest is silence.
