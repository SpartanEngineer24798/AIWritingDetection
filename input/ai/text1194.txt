The electric chair is a method of execution that is only allowed in some parts of the United States. These include Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. However, it's important to remember that it's only used in these states if the person being punished chooses it over injection, or if lethal injection isn't available. Legal punishments can vary greatly between different places and they can often change over time! For example, Nebraska used to have the electric chair, but they don't use it anymore.
