Elijah McCoy, a Canadian-American inventor and engineer, is best known for his pioneering work in lubrication technology, which revolutionized the industrial machine industry in the late 19th century. His major contribution is the invention of the automatic lubricator, often referred to as the "McCoy Oiler". This ingenious device automatically dispensed oil at set intervals to moving parts of a steam engine, thereby reducing the need for frequent stops for manual lubrication and significantly enhance efficiency and productivity. 

McCoy's lubricator was patented in 1872 under the title "Improvement in Lubricators for Steam-Engines". Despite numerous imitations, McCoy's high-quality device remained the preferred choice, earning him the idiom "the real McCoy", which signifies authenticity and superior quality. In total, McCoy received 57 patents, the majority of which pertained to lubrication, but also encompassed a folding ironing board and a lawn sprinkler. His inventions greatly facilitated America's industrial growth during the 19th and 20th centuries.
