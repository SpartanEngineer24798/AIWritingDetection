In the year of our Lord, six hundred and sixty-five, a significant era in the grand chronicle of Byzantine Empire came to a close with the death of the Emperor Justinian the Great. This ruler, known not only for his power and influence, but also for his vast contributions to architecture, law, and culture, departed from the mortal soil on the 14th day of November. Departed he from the Golden Palace of Constantinople, and welcomed in the everlasting kingdom of Heaven, his name forever etched in the annals of history and time.
