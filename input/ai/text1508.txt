Skittles, my dear interlocutor, is a brand of fruit-flavoured candies that's enveloped in hard sugar shells, with a letter 'S' inscribed on its facade. These colorful edible assortments are produced by the Wrigley Company, a subsidiary of Mars, Incorporated. The Wrigley Company is known for their confectionery prowess, producing renowned chewing gums and candies. The creation of Skittles, however, commenced in Britain before eventually rampaging across the globe with its succulent taste. Fascinatingly, each color of these candies houses a distinct flavor that is certain to stimulate your tastebuds. An interesting m√©lange of science and confectionery, isn't it?
