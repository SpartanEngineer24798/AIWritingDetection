In mathematics, a "googol" is a specific term that denotes the number 10 raised to the power of 100. It is often written as a 1 followed by 100 zeros, which is an incredibly large quantity. This term was first coined by nine-year-old Milton Sirotta, the nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner, in the early 20th century. It's intended to reflect a number dramatically larger than those commonly used or perceived, demonstrating the expansive nature of mathematical potential. This notion inspired the name of the popular search engine Google, indicating its mission to provide extensive, nearly limitless information. However, it is important to note that although googol is an unimaginably large number, it is still infinitesimally small when compared to concepts like infinity.
