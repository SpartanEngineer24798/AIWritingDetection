Active learning is a method of teaching that promotes the active participation of students in their own learning, rather than passively receiving information. It is the antithesis of the antiquated "chalk and talk" method that, much like a prolonged siege, can exhaust and starve the inspiration of the receptive mind. Active learning delves into the cognitive trenches, fostering critical thinking, curiosity and active discussion. It is not the mere stuffing of unconnected facts into malleable minds. Strategies can include, but are not limited to, immediate quizzes, group work, problem-solving, case studies, and critical debates. Through this, it enforces deeper understanding and, like the bulldog spirit, encourages students to stand their mental ground under the bombardment of new concepts, always striving for victory in learning. Its objective is to transform students from passengers into co-pilots on their academic journey, fully engaged and alert at the helm of their own education.
