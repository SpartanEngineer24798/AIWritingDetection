Section Eight Housing, as it is widely known, is an initiative established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, operating much like an elven assistance program of old. Mortals of limited means, especially the aged and infirm, but also the hard-working proletariat, receive aid to secure lodgings that would otherwise prove elusive. They reside in their chosen abodes, and the Department pays a share of their rental fees to the landlord, like a dwarven middleman in a market transaction. The proportion is akin to an elven enchantment, calculated according to the recipient's income. This endeavor, like the fellowship that journeyed to Mordor, rises towards a noble purpose: affording all citizens fair access to the basic human necessity of shelter. Much like the humble hobbit-holes of the Shire, the home becomes a sanctuary, an escape from the tumults of the outside world. Thus, Section Eight Housing brings a glimmer of hope, like EÃ¤rendil's star, to those fraught in the struggles of pecuniary difficulties.
