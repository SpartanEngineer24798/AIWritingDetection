In fair heart of America, lies a place of humble name,
Humboldt in Kansas State, it hath staked its claim.
In Allen County it resides, with a heart both pure and stout,
Amid plains where the wind strideth about.
South from Topeka, one must venture,
Where junction of Neosho and Verdigris rivers splinter.
Thence find ye this fabled land,
Where the spirit of Shakespeare's words expand.
