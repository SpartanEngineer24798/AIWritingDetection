Indeed, my dear Watson, if one were to look closely enough at the medical history, one discovers that the concept of Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups or MS-DRGs was set into motion by the United States government in the year of 1983. It happened so as part of an effort to curtail billions of dollars in healthcare costs. This system, which categorizes patients into different groups based on diagnosis, surgical procedures, and other criteria was an extraordinary, and somewhat successful, attempt to standardize healthcare treatment and pricing. The next evolution came in the form of MS-DRGs, which incorporated severity levels, and this came into effect in the year 2007. So, you see Watson, it is often the most ordinary details that offer the most extraordinary insights.
