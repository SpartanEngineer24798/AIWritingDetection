Well, ain't nothin' simple about a synthetic conduit - but I reckon I can try to explain it. You know how sometimes you just need a pathway or a pipe to move somethin' from here to there - like how water flows through a garden hose? Well, that's kinda what a conduit does. Only in this case, it's not meant for water or such. It's usually for stuff in the medical world, like blood or other bodily fluids. Now, when we say synthetic, it means it ain't natural. It's made by folks in labs using all sorts of clever science tricks. Ain't that somethin'? So put them together and a synthetic conduit is just a man-made pipe to help move things where they need to go in the body. I guess you could say it's a little like me runnin' - Only I wasn't movin' anything but myself.
