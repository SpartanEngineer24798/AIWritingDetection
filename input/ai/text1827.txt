Grits, my dear hobbits, are a quaint yet hearty fare, hailing from the distant lands to the west, known as America, more precisely the south. Crafted from a humble seed, the corn; grits originate from a substance known as hominy. Hominy is simply corn that has been thoroughly soaked in a solution, often cooked in an alkali one. This queer process 'doffeth' the husk and germ of the corn, leaving behind the sturdy starchy kernel. 

Once the corn is made into hominy, it is dried thoroughly and then brought to the grindstone. Ground down into a coarse meal, much like a miller grinding wheat into flour, it is transformed. Here, at this juncture in their journey, they acquire the name 'grits'.

Upon cooking, they inflate much as a hobbit might after their third helping of Elevenses, transmuting into soft, creamy morsels. Grits are often served as the cornerstone of a meal, sharing their plate with fervent companions like shrimps, cheese, or gravy. Thus, grits, a versatile grain from the American South, woven by time and toil, bring warmth and sustenance to things that grow.
