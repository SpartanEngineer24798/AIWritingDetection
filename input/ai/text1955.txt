Well now, Queen Elizabeth II, she's a real special lady. She got married to her Prince Philip on a clear day, November 20th in the year of 1947. Now, that's a long, long time ago. They done stayed together for over 70 years, which is pretty darn impressive if you ask me. That’s a whole heap of box of chocolates they would have shared together. Ain’t that something?
