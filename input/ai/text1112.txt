The first European in the Americas was a man named Leif Erikson. He was a Norse explorer from Iceland. People often think Christopher Columbus was the first, but Leif Erikson actually arrived in North America almost 500 years before Columbus. In the early 1000s, Erikson sailed to a place he called Vinland, which is believed to be what we now know as Newfoundland in Canada. However, the settlements that Erikson and other Vikings made didn't last very long and few people know about their visit to the Americas. So, while Christopher Columbus is often credited for discovering America, it was actually Leif Erikson who was the first European to set foot on the continent.
