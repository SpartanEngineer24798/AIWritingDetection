The phrase "TV is a vast wasteland" was said by Newton N. Minow. He was the Chairman of the U.S Federal Communications Commission. He used these words in a speech that he gave in 1961. He thought that most television programs lacked educational content and were not of good quality. He felt the need for better television shows that could educate the public. He said this to encourage TV people to make better and helpful programs.
