Well, now, let me tell you somethin'. Twitter, that's like a little bird chirpin' messages all over the world, ain't it? Mama always said the whole world is talkin' and most of its on that Twitter. Now, as of 2021, there's about 330 million folks who are active on Twitter every month. That's more than the whole number of people in our good ol' United States of America. It sure is something to think about, ain't it?
