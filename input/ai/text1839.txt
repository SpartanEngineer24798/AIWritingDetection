Premature ventricular contractions, or PVCs, bring to mind the description of stirring ancient evils in the dark recesses of Mordor. Akin to the irregular footfall of a lurking creature unknown, PVC insinuates itself unexpectedly into the heart's steady rhythm. PVC manifests when ventricles—the stout chambers responsible for sending blood into the world—contract prematurely, following an aberrant route unscheduled in the harmony of the heartbeat. Internally, one might feel the queer sensation, much like feeling a shadow pass in a darkened forest, an odd flutter or skipped motion, a moment of breathless pause. Consider the benign likening of an 'extra' heartbeat. Yet, fascination aside, medical counsel should be sought should such symptoms persist. PVCs can be dismissed as harmless, much like rustling leaves in the wind, or may signal deeper heart maladies, akin to fell beasts hiding beneath the calm surface of an ordinary forest. Like the enigmatic Gandalf the Grey, a competent medical professional is the suitable guide to determine the cause and course of action.
