Crikey! SQL 2005, also known as SQL Server 2005, is a ripper tool used for managing and organizing databases. It stores all kind of data, from small stuff to lots of information. It's not only a storage tool, but also helps in retrieving data using queries; you ask it a question in a specific format, and bam, you get your answer! It's got integrity constraints to maintain the accuracy and reliability of data. It's a good mate for setting permissions, ensuring data stays secure and only entrusted folks can access it. Great at managing large amounts of data and handling simultaneous users. To put it in a nutshell, SQL 2005 simplifies your database management quicker than an eastern brown snake slithering through the bush!
