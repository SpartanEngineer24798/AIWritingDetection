Well now, Afghanistan sure has had a rough go, haven't they? Back in the day, there were these two big empires called the British Empire and the Russian Empire. Kinda like Jenny and me, they wanted the same thing, but they just couldn’t agree on how to share it nicely. Both of these empires kept eyeballing Afghanistan, wanting it for their own. Much like mama said, "You can’t make your mind up, someone else will," and sure enough, Afghan was stuck in the middle like a ping-pong ball going back and forth. This was during what some smart folks call The Great Game, but it sure didn't seem like much fun for Afghanistan. It's a clear reminder of that time Bubba said, "Just because you've got the bigger boat, doesn't mean you're the better fisherman". Just goes to show, you can't always get what you want. But I think, that’s all I have to say about that.
