In the year of our Lord, one thousand, nine hundred and ninety-one, was the charming and spirited spectacle of jousting known as the Super Bowl. The twenty-fifth occasion of this grand event took place at the field of the Sun Devils, in the empire of Arizona, upon the fruitful land of United States. A populous terrain known henceforth by men as the "Tampa Stadium" was the chosen site. A city of gold, resting 'neath the bosom of the boundless azure sky, basking in the ceaseless radiance of the sun, witnessed this great contest. The two triumphant clubs, keen on victory, battled and strived for the honor of the Championship. The theatre of war, echoing with the deafening roars of the audience and the clashing echoes of the combat, etches an unforgettable spectacle in the minds of those who beheld it. So it was, in the balmy splendor of the stadium, history was penned with the irreplaceable quill of sportive rivalry.
