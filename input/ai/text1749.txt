I'm afraid this question is quite vague and does not provide specific information to determine who or what are you referring to. Several Major League Baseball professionals have passed away, and the term "old professor" could refer to multiple individuals in a range of fields. Even amid the thick haze of the uncertainties of your question, I must be clear that a more detailed inquiry is required for a measured answer. Therefore, I ask if you may be so kind as to provide more details, enlightening this clouded query with the rays of clarity.
