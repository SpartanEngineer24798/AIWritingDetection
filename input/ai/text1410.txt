Crikey! When youâ€™re lookin' at the Massacre at My Lai, which took place during the Vietnam War in March 1968, the fella who was charged with murder is none other than Lieutenant William L. Calley Jr. He was a U.S. Army officer found guilty of ordering his men to slaughter more than 500 Vietnamese civilians, including women and kiddos. This marred the reputation of the U.S. Army, making it one of the most shocking events of the Vietnam War. After a military trial, Calley was convicted of premeditated murder in 1971. He was initially sentenced to life imprisonment, but his term was later reduced and he served only three and a half years under house arrest. The My Lai Massacre remains a dark chapter in U.S. military history.
