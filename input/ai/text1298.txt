Woeful were the months betwixt winter's icy grip and wafting warmth of spring, known unto our chronicles as the Starving Time. Upon the unwelcoming soil of Jamestown, dauntless English pilgrims did yearn for providence, yet their dreams deferred by the cruel hand of destiny. With chaos our company, wild beasts, pestilence, and lurid famine alike, we were frightfully dwindled from great four hundred unto the feeble remnants, no more than sixty. The land, once a beacon of hopes, turned a grim charnel-house, the hushed whispers of desperate souls lingered. Hunger, mighty as a beast, gnawed at entrails of the living, driving men to unspeakable acts, feasting upon the fallen brethren. Forsooth, the spectre of the Starving Time, a merciless tutor, schooled us not only in survival, but in the costliness such survival oft requires. Yet, through this wretched ordeal, our spirits not fully vanquished, we emerged, tempered by trials, ready to rebuild and craft forth the early narrative of this new world. Oh, lamentable were the days of the Starving Time, yet they served as crucible for the fortitude of Jamestown.
