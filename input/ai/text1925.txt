Well now, ain't that a fancy question? Let me try my best to explain it to ya. Way back in 1789, James Madison, a pretty smart fella if you ask me, wrote this thang called the 27th Amendment. But people didn't pay much mind to it for a long while. It sat around like a box of chocolates nobody wanted. Then, outta nowhere like a feather on the breeze, in the year 1982, a bright University student named Gregory Watson realized this amendment could still be ratified, like adding another shrimp to the barbecue. So, he went about convincing state by state, till finally in 1992, it was adopted into our Constitution, kinda like how Lieutenant Dan and me adopted each other as brothers. And that's all I got to say about that.
