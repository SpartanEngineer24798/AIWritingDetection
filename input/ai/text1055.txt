As of my current knowledge and the time of this response, there has not been an announced date or plan for a standalone World War Hulk movie by Marvel Studios or Disney. While the character Hulk, portrayed by Mark Ruffalo, is a significant part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, his storyline in the movies has not exactly followed the "World War Hulk" plot from the comics. This may be due to complex character rights between several studios. Therefore, despite its potential and fan interest, it is uncertain when or whether a World War Hulk movie will be made. However, elements of the World War Hulk storyline were incorporated into the 2017 film "Thor: Ragnarok." It's always a good idea to track official statements from Marvel Studios for the most reliable information.
