Crikey mate! Well, the money used by folks over in South Korea is called the South Korean won. The won is further broken down into 100 jeon, but these aren't much used anymore. Symbol for the won is "â‚©" and its code is KRW. So when you're adventuring over in beautiful Korea, remember to pay in won!
