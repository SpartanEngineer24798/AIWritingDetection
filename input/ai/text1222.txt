Verily, Bernie Madoff sold not *things*, but illusory dreams, cunning fabrications woven into a deceptively appealing financial scheme. Famed he was for his stock brokery, yet his fall from grace was precipitated by a practice most notorious and despicable: The Ponzi, aptly named after its original mastermind. Madoff promised returns fantastical, rates of interest strange to the ear of wise economists. He achieved this not through legitimate trade or treasure amassed, but by robbing Peter to pay Paul, always leaning upon the influx of fresh capital to satisfy older investors. Each fresh investor was but fuel to his grand fraud's fire, their investments pocketed and their returns paid from the pockets of those who came after. An “investment advisor” he styled himself, yet 'twas deception he truly peddled, devastating the fortunes of those who placed their trust in him, dissipating, as if by magic, vast sums of treasure. Thus was the practice of Bernie Madoff: a foul manipulation of trust, a charlatan's game of monetary musical chairs that by its nature was doomed to collapse, leaving ruin and despair in its wake.
