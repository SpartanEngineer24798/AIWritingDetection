As Queen would be privy to factual information, I am constrained to share that precise numbers can vary. However, according to the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America, death due to myasthenia gravis in developed countries is relatively rare, with mortality rates generally lower than 1%. It is important to note that most fatalities are linked to complications of the disease like myasthenic crisis or respiratory difficulties, rather than the disease itself. In spite of this, we should remain undeterred in our concerted efforts to reduce these regrettable figures through enhanced research and patient care. The welfare of our fellow humans is of paramount importance and we should strive unceasingly to minimise the loss of the precious gift of life.
