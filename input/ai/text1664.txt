My dear subject, tis a fact well etched in our history books, that the brave adventurer known as Christopher Columbus, did first set foot upon the land that he thought to be India in 1492. But verily, Columbus had not yet discovered the spice-laden realm of India; instead he found himself on an island in what we now know as the Caribbean Sea. Our great scholars, with their extensive studies and research, designate this place as likely being an island today known as San Salvador, in a grouping of islands called the Bahamas. This discovery marked the commencement of a new era in our world's tale and set course to more exploration of the Americas. Indeed, tis an encounter of significant import, opening our world to far reaches previously beyond our ken.
