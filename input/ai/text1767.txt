My very dear friends, let us consider antibodies, those tiny soldiers of our body's immune system. They stand vigil against foreign invaders, such as viruses and bacteria. Their role is to recognize these metaphorical 'Huns' and thus to halt the invasion before it conquers healthy cells. In medicine, these antibodies are replicated and used in a variety of defence strategies, notably to deal with the COVID19 virus. Their procedure is, I say, as essential as the unity for our nation during the World War. Aiding the immune response, they also play a significant role in research and diagnostics for the benefit of mankind, regardless of frontier or race. Yes, we may say they indeed offer the same sentiment as my great motto; I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. Today, in our hands, these antibodies bear a large part of the burden and heat of the day. Their tireless wartime effort, much like ours during the Blitz, fights on the beaches, on the landing grounds, in the fields and in the streets of our bodies, ensuring a shield exists for the forces of good health to prevail.
