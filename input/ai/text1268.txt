In 1961, FCC Chairman, a man of wise discernment, Newton Minow, did proclaim his pointed observation most distinct, noting, "TV doth become a vast wasteland." This was in his maiden speech, famously named "Vast Wasteland," in which he did bear heavy criticism toward the content and quality appearing on television's glowing screen- a garden blooming with emptiness, he perceived. He questioned the worth of its programming, likening it to a desolate desert, barren of any enriching sustenance. Verily, he implored broadcasters to strive nobler, to seek beyond profitability, to give due respect to their audiences, and sow seeds for a verdant landscape of intellectual growth, cultural richness, and educated discourse. His words did ring in the air, reverberating through the chambers of time, protracted in the quest for betterment in broadcasting. Thus, it was Newton Minow, harking from the age of amplified signals and cathode rays, who declared, "TV is a vast wasteland."
