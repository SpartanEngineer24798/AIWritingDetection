In the dense, winding labyrinth of Natureâ€™s own tale, there lurks a villain of vile influence; a malevolent marauder that ensnares the unsuspecting in its perfidious grasp. Its dreadful name is whispered only in hushed tones and echoing silence: the Human Immunodeficiency Virus - a merciless adversary to mankind. A saga of suffering and strife, it tells.

Unlike the cruel dragons or wizened goblins that filled the ignored corners of Middle Earth, this foe is not confined to the realm of the fantastic or the dimensions of the quill. It enters the bastion of human life, and targets the very guardians of the body: the immune system. Its cunning is unmatched; taking the form of an insidious spy, it covertly infiltrates the ranks. Unseen, unperturbed, it begins to unravel its cruel plot, instigating discord and inciting rebellion.

In the end, the once robust citadel of the body is reduced to ruins. The once courageous soldiers of immunity, to fragments. As the final act of its treacherous performance, it gives rise to a chilling affliction, one cloaked in despair and dread: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS as it is fearfully known.
