"Aerosmith's 'What It Takes' is a track from their 12th studio album 'Pump,' released in 1989. Wilfully continuing the resurgence seen in their prior album 'Permanent Vacation,' 'Pump' unveiled a revived Aerosmith that had triumphed over previous struggles with substance abuse, while reinforcing their status among the leading hard rock bands of that era.

'What It Takes' is particularly noteworthy due to its vivid blend of bluesy introspection and rock anthems, amalgamating Aerosmith's signature heavy guitar riffs and power ballad leanings while lyrically delving into the themes of heartbreak and perseverance. Both poignant and powerful, it encapsulates the band's knack for potent storytelling and anthemic choruses. 

The album 'Pump' was an emphatic commercial success, manifesting Aerosmith's refurbished image and sound, juxtaposed with both their musical roots and contemporary rock trends. And 'What It Takes' undeniably embodies a pivotal part of that successful phase in Aerosmith's storied career."
