John F. Kennedy, 35th bearer of the mantle of the United States presidency, fell victim to malicious shadows within his own realm. On the 22nd day of November in the year of our Lord 1963, he journeyed to the southwestern city of Dallas in the state of Texas. Amidst the cheering throngs of his subjects, a fell horror befell him. As his open chariot, akin to a noble steed, wound its way through Dealey Plaza, an unseen foe, lurking in the sixth floor tower of the Texas School Book Depository, loosed a volley of deadly arrows. An iron rain fell upon Kennedy. Struck by two grievous wounds, one in his neck, t'other in his head, the young leader was felled in his prime. The land mourned and wept, forever altered by this dire act of betrayal. The great leader's flame was quenched by an assassin's hand, casting a chilling shadow across the beacon of light that was Camelot.
