Well, now, ain't this a fine question? You're askin' 'bout the Constitution. You know, the big important paper that tells us how to run this country we love so dearly. It was written quite some time ago. We're talking 'bout way back, when Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and them folks got together. Wanting to make things fair and square for everyone, they sat down and began to write in the year 1787. Can you imagine that? That's over 200 years ago! That's like a really long bus ride. So, there's your answer. 1787. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to find some shrimp.
