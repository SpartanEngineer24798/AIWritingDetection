Well now, let me tell you, Modesto is like a box of chocolates. It's right there in the state of California, which kind folks say is charming as can be. If you're headed there, this is how you'd go - west from Yosemite National Park, or maybe south from Sacramento. But if you're coming from the city on the bay, San Francisco, well you'd just have to mosey on east. So, whether you're runnin' like me or just travelin' slow as a Sunday mornin', you'd find it smack dab in the central part of California. That's where Modesto is. And that's all I have to say about that.
