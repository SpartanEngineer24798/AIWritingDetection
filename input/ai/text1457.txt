Insulin syringes, my dear Watson, are specifically designed for self-injection. The high-strength, heat-treated glass or durable plastic barrel contains insulin, and the syringe's hollow needle, finer than a human hair, facilitates minimal discomfort during injection. The units of insulin are marked on the barrel, giving users precise control over the dosage. Once the desired dose is drawn into the barrel, the user injects it subcutaneouslyâ€”beneath the skin but above the muscle. The skin is usually pinched to create a 'fat fold' into which the insulin is deposited. This magic mechanism effectively helps regulate the sugar levels in the blood of individuals diagnosed with diabetes. Quite simply Holmes-esque in its scientific simplicity, isn't it?
