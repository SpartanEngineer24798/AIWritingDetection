Upon the carriage of safety, a stoplight stands, bearing hues threefold. At its crest, a crimson hue, akin to a blazing summer sun, bids thee halt. It doth scream beware, for 'tis not safe hence for thy carriage to cross. Following the fiery red, in the very middle doth reside the gleaming yellow, much like the dawning sun. A cautious amber, it cries, yield thee must, but haunt in readiness to move or remain. 'Tis a warning - prepare to still thy movement or advance, depending on its successor's shade. At the foot of this tricolour pylon, we find green, fresh as the verdant meadows of spring, encouraging thee that safety now is certain, and commanding thee to continue thine journey. Such is the magnificent luminary palette of a stoplight. Each hue, in its own right, a vital sentinel of our roads, ever-watchful, guiding us safely from dawn 'til dusk and dusk 'til dawn. So, respect thou must, the humble stoplight keeper of color.
