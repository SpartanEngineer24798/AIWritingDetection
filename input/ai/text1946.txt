Well now, Dr. JB Danquah, he was this smart man born in Ghana, Africa, a long, long way from Greenbow, Alabama. He born back in 1895, and he sure did a lot of things. He was a lawyer, and he helped write the constitution of Ghana. Now, the constitution, that's a big ole fancy document that tells people how to run the country. But that's not all. He also founded a political party, named the United Gold Coast Convention. That's like having your very own football team, only they play with words and ideas instead of pigskin. He spent some time in prison for his beliefs, sort of like how I went to Vietnam. But he kept fighting for what he believed in. Some folk say, he was one of the main folks helped Ghana become its own free country. I reckon that makes him a pretty important fella.
