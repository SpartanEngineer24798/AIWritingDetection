Crikey mate! Passover, a major Jewish holiday, lasts for eight days in most parts of the world, but in Israel, it's just seven days. It typically begins on the 15th day of Nisan, which is in the early spring. The first two and the last two days are full-fledged holidays. The ones in between, they're semi-festive days known as Chol Hamoed. Now, the dates might differ depending on where you geographically are because it's based on the Hebrew lunar calendar, but generally, it falls between late March to late April. So to sum it up, you can say goodbye to Passover after eight days - or seven, if you're in Israel. Beauty!
