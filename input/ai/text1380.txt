Crikey mate! That was a horrific event that happened in 1995, it’s called the Oklahoma City bombing. A true tragedy. Now, if we're talking about the number of people who unfortunately lost their lives, the count reaches a total of 168, with loads of others injured as well. It’s an incident that left an awful scar on the grand landscape that makes up our human history, reminding us of the senseless violence that can occur when we lose sight of our shared humanity. Makes your heart heavy, doesn't it? Our thoughts are always with the victims' friends and families. Let's remember to treat each other a bit kinder, just like we would in the wild. You never know how much time you've got with someone, or something. That's why we've got to do our best to protect and respect all life, mate.
