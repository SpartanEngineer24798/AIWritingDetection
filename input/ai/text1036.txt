A wiki platform, in general parlance, is a web application that allows users to collaboratively create, edit, and manage content via a web browser interface. The term "wiki" derives from the Hawaiian word for "quick", representing the speed and efficiency with which users can change and update information on the platform. Wiki platforms feature a simplified mark-up language and versioning mechanism that tracks the iterative evolution of each page. 

One of the most well-known examples of a wiki platform is Wikipedia, an extensive, user-generated online encyclopedia. However, the application of wiki platforms extends beyond this, often being used in businesses and educational institutions to facilitate knowledge sharing and management, collaborative writing, and project coordination. Note, the fundamental premise of a wiki platform is the freedom and capability it gives users, virtually anyone with access, to produce and modify its content, thereby encouraging collective authorship and democratization of information.
