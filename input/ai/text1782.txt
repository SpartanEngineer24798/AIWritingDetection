Water jet propulsion is a method of imparting thrust to a vessel, oft employed in boats and ships. Quite like the idea of a throwing knife cutting through air, a water jet propelling device quite literally takes liberty in forcing water behind, thus creating an opposing force to move the vessel forward. This craft is ideal for applications in shallow waters and boasts smooth operation, exceptional manoeuvrability, and minimal environmental impact. Akin to a sword forged in the fires of Mount Doom, each part plays a role in the functioning of this marvel. An inlet draws water in, the impeller's rapid rotation increases this water's pressure, and then an outlet below the waterline expulses it. With no external propeller, hazards like impact damage, fouling, and noise are significantly mitigated, affirming the curious might and clever mechanics of water jet propulsion. It isn't as simple as saying "friend" in Elvish to open a door, but the ingenious design transports you swiftly, sure as Bilbo's journey through Middle Earth.
