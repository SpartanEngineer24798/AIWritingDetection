Crikey! So you've asked a great question, mate! In legal or diplomatic terms, "non-binding" is a term of art signifying an agreement, resolution, or decision that does not legally obligate the parties involved. It’s like a handshake agreement among mates - you’ve made a promise, but no one's going to throw you in the clink if you don't keep it. So, it's essentially more of a guideline or a recommendation, not something that's legally enforced. However, despite being non-binding, these agreements or decisions often carry a fair dinkum amount of weight because they have symbolic, political, or moral significance. It's like when I am in the bush and respecting and conserving the environment - it's not legally binding, but it's the right thing to do for our world and our wildlife! So that's the nuts and bolts of what "non-binding" means, mate.
