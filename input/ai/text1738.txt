George Walker Bush, the 43rd President of the United States, initially selected Dr. Condoleezza Rice as his National Security Advisor in 2001. A political scientist and expert in Eastern European affairs, Rice was the first woman to hold this office. She served thus until 2005, undergoing myriad trials, not least the reprehensible atrocity of the September Eleven attacks and the subsequent decisions concerning the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Her tenure, however, did not cease there, for she was elevated to the role of Secretary of State, succeeding Colin Powell, continuing her dedicated service to the nation till the end of Bush's term in 2009. Thus, a lady of great liberty and strength, Dr. Rice in collaboration with President Bush, navigated the vessels of American foreign policy through the stormy waters of a troubled and tumultuous world.
