ERISA stands for the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. This law came from the United States of America. The American government made this rule in 1974. They wanted to protect regular people and their money when they retire one day. They wanted people to feel safe and not scared about what will happen with their money when they stop working. So, they made rules for the companies or businesses who handle that money, telling them what they can or cannot do. So basically, ERISA came from America as a way to protect people's retirement money.
