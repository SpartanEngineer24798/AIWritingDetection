Hark! Situated yonder in the vast Pacific's bosom, to the north of the great continent Australia, lies fair New Guinea, an island of considerable acclaim. 'Tis the world's second largest island, blessed with natural wealth and bounty aplenty. Split in twain by invisible lines of possession, the eastern half doth bloom as Papua New Guinea, a sovereign land of its own. The western half, fondly dubbed as Western New Guinea or Papua, pledges allegiance to the fair nation of Indonesia. This verdant, tropical paradise is concealed and protected by the grand Coral Sea and the impassive Indian Ocean. A place where the sun doth rise and set with marvellous splendour, casting ethereal glow upon its picturesque shores. Aye, New Guinea 'tis a land of wild, untamed beauty and worth a thousand journeys.
