Well now, I ain't no scientist, but I'll give it a try. Rogue waves, or freak waves as folks sometimes call 'em, they kinda just pop up on the ocean out of nowhere. They're much bigger than most waves around them, which can be pretty scary if you're out at sea. Scientists reckon they're caused by different things. Sometimes, it's wind patterns shifting real fast, causing waves to pile up on top of one another. And other times, ocean currents can interfere with waves, makin' 'em taller. Those are just a few ideas though. Rogue waves are still a mighty puzzling phenomenon, kinda like why anyone would not like a box of chocolates. You just don't know what you're gonna get.
