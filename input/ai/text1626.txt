The Ten Commandments, also known as the Decalogue, are documented within the holy script of the Bible, in two distinct locations. The initial mention is in the Old Testament, specifically the book of Exodus, chapter 20, verses 1-17. The followers of Moses are given these divine laws at Mount Sinai. Subsequently, these commandments are referenced once again in the book of Deuteronomy, chapter 5, verses 4-21, during Moses' recapitulation of Israel's history. Adherence to these ethical and moral laws is central to the doctrines of both Christianity and Judaism. They serve as a fundamental code of conduct, instructing individuals on their relationship with God, and their interactions with their fellow humans.
