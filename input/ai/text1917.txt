Well now, ain't that a song for the ages. Just like momma always said, "Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get" -- and with Aerosmith, we got a real treat. That song "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" that y'all asking about, it came out in 1998. Yep, 1998. They did it for this movie about space and that there ol' Bruce Willis, called "Armageddon." It was a real tear-jerker, touched many hearts, just like when I lost Jenny. So yes sir, 1998, that's the ticket.
