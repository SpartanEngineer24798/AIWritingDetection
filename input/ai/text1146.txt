Daylight savings time started a long time ago, in 1916, during World War I. The first country to use it was Germany. They started it to save energy. When we use daylight savings time, we move our clocks one hour ahead in the spring and one hour back in the fall. This way, we can use the daylight more and don't need to use as much electricity for lights in the evening. It's like we're "saving" the daylight for when we need it most. That's why it's called "daylight savings time". Other countries saw Germany doing this and thought it was a good idea, so they started using daylight savings time too. But not every country uses it. They can decide if they want to or not. And some places in the same country might use it while other places don't.
