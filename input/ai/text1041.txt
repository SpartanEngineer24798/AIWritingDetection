The one hundred dollar banknote of the United States prominently features the image of Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers and a polymath who contributed significantly to various fields such as science, invention, politics, and writing. Considered the father figure of American Enlightenment, Franklin's likeness was first showcased on the hundred dollar bill in 1914 in recognition of his multifaceted contributions to the birth and evolution of America. The addition of security measures like watermarks and color-shifting ink over time has subtly altered the depiction, but the base design remains constant to the revered Franklin. Arguably, Benjamin Franklin's presence on the hundred dollar bill is a homage to his enduring legacy.
