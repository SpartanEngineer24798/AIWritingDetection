Well, now, I ain't no smart man, but I do remember Mr. Richard Nixon, our 37th President, getting himself into one big ol' pickle. You see, sir, he got accused of somethin' called "Watergate," which ain't about a gate holding water, but about some fellas breakin' into the Democratic National Committee headquarters at a hotel called Watergate. They were tryinâ€™ to wiretap phones and steal documents, tryin' to get dirt on Nixon's opponents. They were caught and folks found out they were linked to Nixon's re-election campaign. That ain't the worst part, though. Mr. Nixon and his folks tried to cover the whole thing up, which is a big no-no. When it all came out, folks were mighty upset and impeachment talks started. Rather than face that, Mr. Nixon decided to up and quit - the first time any president had done that. So, basically, Mr. Nixon was accused of breakin' into a place, stealin' secrets, and lyin' about it, which is not very presidential if you ask me.
