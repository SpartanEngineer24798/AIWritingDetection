Well now, a store confectioner is someone who makes all sorts of sweet goodies like candies, chocolates, and gumdrops right there in a store. Just like Bubba knew everything about shrimping, a store confectioner knows all about making confections. They might work at a candy store, a bakery, or even a grocery store that have their own candy section. They might make hard candies or soft ones, chocolate covered nuts or caramel apples, or even marshmallows. They use a bunch of different sugars, syrup nâ€™ flavors and they heat them and stir them and shape them into all kinds of tasty treats. My mama always said, "Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're going to get." Well, with a store confectioner, sometimes you do know because you watched them make it, and that's pretty special.
