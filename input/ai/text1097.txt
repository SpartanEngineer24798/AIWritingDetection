The type of democracy where all citizens have direct rights and the ability to participate in governmental decisions is called Direct Democracy. This sort of political system is also referred to as pure democracy. Considering the Greek roots of the term 'democracy', which mean 'the people rule', it aligns with the most literal interpretation of this concept. In direct democracy, citizens typically vote on laws, policies, or specific issues rather than relying on elected representatives to make these decisions. They may also have a say in the administration's actions and have the power to remove any officials they deem unfit. However, due to practical challenges, a pure form of direct democracy is rare today. It is often mixed with representative democracy, forming what we call a semi-direct or participatory democracy. Notably, even in this amalgamated form, mechanisms such as referendums and initiatives keep the spirit of direct citizen participation alive.
