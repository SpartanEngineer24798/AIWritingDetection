Crikey! 'Barefoot and pregnant' might sound like a bit of an unconventional phrase in the Outback. This phrase originates from the old traditional belief that women should stay at home, barefoot, and be continuously pregnant or looking after kids, rather than pursuing careers or activities outside the home. Today, we view women as capable of doing whatever they desire, balancing family and work life if they choose. This old term isn't much in use anymore, but when used, it typically refers to limiting a woman's opportunities, mate. This isn't in line with modern views of gender equality, so it's considered a bit of a dated term now. So, remember, let's respect all creatures in our vast, diverse world - women, men, and all the glorious animals we share this planet with!
