Our kidneys are found inside our body, just above our waist towards the back. If you place your hands on your hips, you can feel your kidneys just above that point. They are protected by our rib cage and back muscles. We have two kidneys; one on the right side and the other one on the left side of our body. They are in the shape of beans and around the size of a human fist. Our kidneys are very important because they clean our blood by removing waste and producing pee.
