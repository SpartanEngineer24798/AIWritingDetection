It suggests, my dear Watson, that the arches on your feet are collapsed, resulting in your entire foot making contact with the ground when standing. This condition, in medical parlance, is known as pes planus or flat foot. While its origin rides on the back of various factors, heredity is the front-running horse. A few may experience no discomfort in their heels or arch area, yet for others, pain might make its unpleasant visit along with instability in certain activities. It is, however, essential to remember, Watson, that like all physiological anomalies, the severity and consequential implications vary resourcefully between individuals. Given this, it would be a grave mistake to form a firm prognosis without deeper observation. A consultation with a medical practitioner or a podiatrist will serve you well in this respect.
