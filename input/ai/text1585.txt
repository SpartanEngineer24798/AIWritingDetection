The rotation of our sphere, Earth, around our majestic star, the Sun, fastened on its elliptical orbit, precipitates what we call 'seasons'. The Earth's axis is not perpendicular, rather it tilts at a slant of 23.5 degrees. As a result, as we travel around the Sun, the Sun appears to wax and wane in height above our horizon, that is to say, the amount of sunlight received differs from time to time in different parts. In those eras when the Sun is high, say, during the zenith of the day, we experience warmer spells, and this we refer to as 'Summer'. As the Sun descends, temperatures drop, heralding the advent of 'Winter'. The moments of transition, when our grand star is equidistant from the horizon, are termed 'Spring' and 'Autumn'. Pray, learn how our universe is oft coordinating an elaborate dance, harmonious and beautiful, a testament to the miracles of creation.
