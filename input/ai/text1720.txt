The early history of cinema was predominantly monochromatic. It wasn't until the mid-20th century that colour in films became practical and commonly used. The two most noteworthy achievements in rendering colour films were Technicolor's successive innovations: a two-colour system introduced in the 1920s, and a three-colour system in 1932. Technicolorâ€™s three strip method records the red, green, and blue components of each scene individually, providing an enhanced richness of colour. Notable early productions demonstrating this splendour of colour included the cinematic milestones Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz, both released in 1939. Today, the richness and vibrancy of colour in films are taken for granted. Ranging from subtle gradations to vibrant contrasts, the colour spectrum stirs in us profound emotional responses, paving the way for more visceral storytelling in cinema. Hence, this ingenious technological development, of colour film, ought to be duly celebrated.
