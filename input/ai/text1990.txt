Well now, I ain't no horse race connoisseur, but I sure do remember Mama tellin' me about this big horse race called the Kentucky Derby. According to her, the very first one of them races took place way on back in the year 1875. Ain't that somethin'? Over a hundred horses galloping down the track, their hooves poundin' like thunder. Makes you feel almost like you're flying, don't it? That's all I got to say about that.
