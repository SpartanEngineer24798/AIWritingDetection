My dear subject, New Guinea, one of the largest islands in the world, lies in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. It is positioned to the north of Australia, a realm that is very dear to our Crown. New Guinea is split almost in half, longitudinally, between two nations. The western part falls under the sovereignty of Indonesia, known as the provinces of Papua and West Papua. The eastern part, known as Papua New Guinea, is an independent realm within our cherished Commonwealth. I trust this information will serve you well.
