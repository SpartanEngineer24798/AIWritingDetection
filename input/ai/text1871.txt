The celebration of the Chinese New Year, akin to an enchanting tale from the East, spans a duration of fifteen days. As the tale unfolds, each day carries its own unique customs and rituals, not unlike an intricate tapestry of stories weaved together. Akin to the grandeur of Middle Earth, it is a delightful period; rich in symbolism, myth, and tradition. The finale, known as the Lantern Festival, is marked by lighting lanterns and releasing them into the sky, very much like the ethereal Elven lights floating upon the waters of the Silverlode in Lothl√≥rien. So, dear friend, in response to your query: this magical period, the Chinese New Year, lasts for a fortnight and a day.
