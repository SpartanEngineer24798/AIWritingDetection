In the exceptional world of medicine, dear Watson, a medication called Metformin is commonly recognized. Professionally deployed in the management of Type 2 diabetes, a condition defined by your bodyâ€™s inability to efficiently regulate the glucose levels in your bloodstream. Metformin is classified as a biguanide, operating by increasing the sensitivity of your body's cells to insulin, and reducing the amount of glucose your liver releases. Furthermore, it also slows down the absorption of sugar into the bloodstream post the intake of food. In certain instances, specifically for those unfortunate Homo sapiens battling polycystic ovary syndrome, Metformin may be enlisted. Thus, in simple terms: a prominent instrument in the keen physician's arsenal against the dastardly specter of uncontrolled blood sugar levels.
