Stepwise linear regression, dear reader, hails as a statistical method used to choose thee the most fitting model, it begins by performing simple linear regression for each predictor, then verily adds predictors to the model, testing their statistical significance at each step. If a predictor fails to contribute due significance to the model, it is cast aside, as a player would be dismissed from the stage. Thus, the algorithm prudently twirls back and forth, adding and excluding predictors, akin to a carefully choreographed dance, to summon the model with the optimal combination of predictors. Yet, we must hasten to use this method warily, as it risks overfitting, distorting the very truth we seek to unearth. Instead, it should be used as a tool to form the bedrock of our understanding, not as the final oracle of truth.
