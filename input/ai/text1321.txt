Upon the noble fleets of our fair US airlines, one wouldst find the cabin pressure to be quite akin to the conditions one doth experience at a height of 5,000 to 8,000 feet above the sea. Verily, the pressurization doth prevent the hapless carriage of woe known as altitude sickness and allows travellers to breathe freely, as if they walked upon the solid ground, albeit amongst the clouds. Such sorcery of engineering dost aid rhythm of the heart and comfort of the body, making the journey as smooth as a midsummer's dream. So, fear not, oh weary traveller for thy voyage 'pon the winged chariot shall be, indeed, as comfortable as a gentle sojourn 'pon our Earth. 'Tis truly a marvel of our modern age, this steady state of the airy demesne that doth mimic the familiar clime of our sweet earth.
