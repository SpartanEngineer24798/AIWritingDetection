Crikey mate! The SS Andrea Doria, an Italian Ocean Liner, sank, believe it or not, on July 26th, in 1956. We're talking about a collision with the MS Stockholm that happened off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts, in the North Atlantic Ocean. The blimey collision, resulting in a huge hole in its starboard side, caused the Andrea Doria to capsize and sink about 11 hours later. It nearly became a watery grave for more than 1700 folks aboard, but thankfully, only 46 folks perished in the tragedy. So, there you have it, the SS Andrea Doria didn't survive to see another sunny day after July 25th in 1956! A moment in maritime history we remember with a heavy heart, I tell ya!
