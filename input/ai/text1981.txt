Well now, you know, artichoke ain't like a regular ol' fruit or vegetable with seeds you can find right off the bat. No sir, artichoke's a special plant and she's a flower, actually. And just like a flower - you gotta make sure she's done blooming before you go lookin' for seeds. You see, normally we munch on the bud part before it even gets a chance to bloom. But if you let her bloom, you gonna find the seeds right there in the purple-blue flowers that come out. That's right. It ain't in the part that you eat, it's in the flower once it has finished bloomin'. But you gotta be patient, cause just like Mama used to say, good things take time. So, in a nutshell, or should I say an artichoke, the seed's in the flower part, which ain't edible, but sure is pretty.
