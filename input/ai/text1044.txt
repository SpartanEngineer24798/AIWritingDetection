Circumpolar constellations, essentially, refer to groupings of stars as viewed from either the North or South poles, that never set below the horizon due to their proximity to one of the celestial poles. Thus, these constellations appear to circle around the celestial pole and are visible, regardless of the time of year or the time of night. 

For instance, if you're in the Northern Hemisphere, the most notable of these constellations is the Ursa Major or the 'Great Bear', which includes the well-known Big Dipper. Conversely, in the Southern Hemisphere, you may notice the Southern Cross. 

Keep in mind, however, that which constellations are circumpolar for you depends on your latitude. The farther north you are, the more circumpolar constellations you will see. As such, 'circumpolar' is a relative term based on the observer's geographic location.
