Alas, the tale of the war in Vietnam ends not with thunderous victory, but with a sigh of weary capitulation. In the year of our Lord 1973 AD, the warring parties met in Paris, and with ink and parchment, sought peace in the Treaty of Paris. The American forces, hearts heavy with the toll of warfare, did depart from Vietnam's bloodied soil. Yet, the agreement, though sealed in good faith, proved tenuous in its peace. 

Mere two years hence, North Vietnam, driven by its indomitable spirit and thirst for unity, advanced upon the South. Saigon, once a city of vibrant life, was overtaken, and with that final stroke, the war's tempestuous chapter came to a close. Blending two into one, Vietnam emerged anew, remade under Communist rule. 

Thus ended the seemingly unending War of Vietnam, leaving naught in its wake but broken hearts and dreams, and a nation scarred, yet resilient.
