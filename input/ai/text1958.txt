Well, alright, I ain't no good at this fancy talking, but I reckon I can tell you 'bout Henry Sampson Jr. He's one of them smart fellers, you know, an inventor and engineer. Born around the same time as me, in 1934 down in Jackson, Mississippi. He got the same name as his pop, so folks called him Junior. Now this Mr. Sampson, he was the first African-American man to earn a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering in the US of A. That's mighty impressive, I tell ya. You thought he'd stop there, but he didn't. He went on to invent the gamma-electric cell. That has something to do with generating electrical power from the energy in gamma radiation. Got kinda mixed up with the folks that said he invented the cell phone, but that ain't quite right. But donâ€™t matter much, cause what he did was still plenty smart, and ain't nobody can take that away from him.
