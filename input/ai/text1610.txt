The members of the Climax Blues Band have varied over the course of time. The original line-up that was formed in 1968, in Stafford, England included Colin Cooper (vocals/saxophone), Pete Haycock (guitar), Derek Holt (bass), and George Newsome (drums). Later, the band also welcomed Richard Jones (keyboards) and Lester Hunt (guitar). In 1983, John 'Rhino' Edwards joined briefly as a bassist before he became part of the Status Quo. Over time, sadly, some members such as Cooper and Haycock have departed this mortal coil. As of now, the ensemble comprises of Graham Dee (vocals), Lester Hunt (guitar), George Glover (keyboards), Neil Simpson (bass), and Roy Adams (drums). Their consistent grasp of the blues genre has had them entertain and charm audiences for over five decades, demonstrating durability and fascinating gifts in music. Despite changes, the Climax Blues Band's essence remains integral to their identity.
