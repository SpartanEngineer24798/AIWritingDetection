Crikey mate! People of Japanese descent who are living in the United States, whether they were born there or immigrated, are commonly referred to as Japanese Americans. They're part of the rich tapestry of America's diverse cultural heritage. Just like the animals in the wild, every community brings its own unique contributions to the American habitat! Startling, isn't it? It's a beautiful blend of traditions and cultures, just like the captivating ecosystems that we work to protect. Fantastic!
