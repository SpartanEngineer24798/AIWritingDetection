Sesame seeds come from sesame plants which grow in tropical parts of the world. The little seeds are inside small pods that grow on the plant. When the pods become ripe, they open up and the tiny sesame seeds come out! These seeds can be in different colors like white, black, and even yellow. The seeds can be used on bread, in cooking, and they can also be squeezed to make sesame oil. So, that's where our tasty sesame seeds come from!
