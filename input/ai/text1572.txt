My dear subject, the concoction that you refer to as mustard predominantly consists of the seeds of the mustard plant. These seeds, when crushed, yield a spicy oil that's responsible for mustard's distinct, sharp flavour. Additionally, to create the paste we commonly see, water, vinegar, or other liquids, such as wine or beer, are introduced. Further adjuncts like sugar or salt might be added according to individual preference. The type of mustard plant, preparation methods, and any additional elements contribute to the wide variety of mustards available to us, much like the diverse and delightful constituents of our realm.
