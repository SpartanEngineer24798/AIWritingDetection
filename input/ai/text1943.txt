Well now, evoked otoacoustic emissions, or EOE's as some folks call 'em, are sounds that come from the ear when it reacts to sounds or vibrations. You see, doctors and hearing specialists, they test these sounds to see if a person, especially a baby, has hearing loss or not. They put a tiny speaker and microphone inside your ear, make some soft clicks or tones, and then measure them little sounds that come back. Ain't nothing to be scared of, it doesn't hurt or nothing. Just helps them figure out if you're hearing as perfect as a hummingbird or if things are a bit quiet for you. And I think, that's all I've to say about that.
