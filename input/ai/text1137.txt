Active learning strategies are cool ways we use to learn better. Instead of just listening to our teacher, we actually get to do stuff and be involved in our learning! These include activities like group works where we discuss and solve problems together. Then there's role-play, where we act out situations, or guess-tasks where we make predictions and test them out. We can also use flashcards to remember things better. Sometimes, we use games, like puzzles or quizzes to make learning fun. In active learning, we get to ask questions, share our ideas and think creatively. It's like being a little explorer on a learning adventure! So, active learning isn't just reading or writing, it's learning by doing, discussing, and discovering!
