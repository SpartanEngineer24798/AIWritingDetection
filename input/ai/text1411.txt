Crikey mate! Mucous membranes are as fascinating as a kookaburra in flight! These membranes secrete a sticky substance called mucus. This substance serves as the body's first line of defense. Mucus acts like a slippery goalie, catching and trapping nasty microscopic invaders like bacteria, dust, and viruses. Not only does it capture these tiny intruders, but it also adds moisture to different parts and canals of our body, preventing them from drying out. It's like your bodyâ€™s own irrigation system! The way Mother Nature designs our bodies for survival, it's absolutely bonzer!
