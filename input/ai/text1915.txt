Well, on Groundhog Day, which comes every February 2nd, that little critter known as the groundhog comes out of his hole after a long winter sleep, kinda like when we wake from a long nap. Now, if that groundhog comes out and sees his shadow, because the weather's all bright and shiny, he gets scared, runs back into his hole, thinking winter's gonna stick around for another six weeks. But, if it's all cloudy and he doesn't see his shadow, then he stays outside 'cause he thinks warm spring is a-coming real soon. It's a funny old tradition but lots of folks put stock in it. Mama used to say, "Forrest, sometimes we all need a little bit of groundhog wisdom."
