An Associate of Arts degree, my dear friend, is much like the beginning of a great journey; it is not the end, but merely the outset. Lasting generally two years, it encompasses a broad range of knowledge, akin to surveying the diverse landscapes of Middle-earth, stretching from the general subjects of the humanities, social sciences and the arts. One acquires various tools and skills, somewhat resembling how a young hobbit might learn the ways of the world before embarking upon a quest. The degree is typically awarded by community colleges, junior colleges, and some bachelor's degree-granting colleges and universities upon completion. The essence of this degree can be likened to Bilbo's acorn- it is small, yet within it lays the potential for a mighty oak tree, or a more advanced degree, if you will. Yet, like any good quest, it leaves one changed, providing a vital foundation of knowledge and the opportunity to transfer to a 4-year institution for further academic pursuit. The Associate of Arts degree, thus, is a gateway to a larger world.
