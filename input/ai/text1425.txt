Crikey mate! The first weekend of September in the U.S. brings us an absolute beauty of a holiday, it's Labor Day! This day is typically celebrated on the first Monday of September. It's a day dedicated to the social and economic achievements of American workers - they're the true salt of the earth, the backbone of the country! It's a creation of the labor movement and is a national tribute to the contributions workers have made to the strength, success, and of course, the tough-as-nails grit of their country, mate. Families usually enjoy a barbie with snags, steaks, and burgers, maybe even hit up a parade or two. It's a ripper of a day to kick back, relax, and celebrate hard work!
