Crikey mate! Louisiana's as wild as the Outback sometimes! And they've got their fair share of political face-offs too. As of now, the two blokes representing Louisiana in the U.S. Senate are John Kennedy and Bill Cassidy. Senator Cassidy, who is a member of the Republican party, was first elected back in 2014 and has been serving the Pelican State since then. Senator Kennedy, also a Republican, joined him in the Senate in 2017. What a pair! They're taking a bite at the Senate, just like a saltie grabs a barramundi. Keep an eye on these two, mate!
