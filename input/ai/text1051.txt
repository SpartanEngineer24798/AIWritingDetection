Chicken chow mein is a popular dish in Chinese cuisine and American-Chinese cuisine. The etymological roots are traced back to the Taishan dialect of Cantonese, where "chow mein" translates roughly to "stir-fried noodles". Essentially, chicken chow mein is a noodle-based dish. It primarily consists of chicken breast, which is often marinated and then saut√©ed, and a variety of vegetables such as bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, and bean sprouts. These components are generally stir-fried separately, and then combined with the cooked noodles. The combined mixture is then tossed in a pan to allow the flavors to meld, and typically seasoned with soy sauce, oyster sauce, or hoisin sauce. There is ostensibly a lack of standardization in its preparation, leading to regional and individual variations. However, despite these differences, chicken chow mein remains a well-recognized dish and holds a prominent position in many Chinese diaspora communities around the globe.
