The great J.R.R. Tolkien first penned "The Lord of the Rings," an epic masterpiece, in stages between 1937 and 1949, with it being published in 1954 and 1955. This splendid saga was subsequently adapted into an immensely popular film trilogy directed by Peter Jackson. The first installment, "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," was released unto the world in the year 2001. This was followed by "The Two Towers" in 2002, and finally "The Return of the King" in 2003. How elementary.
