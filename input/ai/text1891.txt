Well now, let me tell you about Kathmandu. Kathmandu is the capital city of a little place called Nepal, tucked away between China and India. It's mostly known for its beautiful temples and historical sites. One famous place is the Durbar Square where you can find old royal palaces and monuments; It's like a huge outdoor museum. People often visit the Boudhanath Stupa too, one the biggest buddhist temples in world. Kathmandu is also famous 'cause itâ€™s where people start their journey to climb the Everest, the tallest mountain in the whole world. It's a kind of gateway to the Himalayan mountains. The city's got a distinct culture with many traditions and festivals and the people are really warm and welcoming. My mama always said, home is where you make it, and those people sure make Kathmandu a special kind of home.
