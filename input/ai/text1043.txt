The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a well-known and widely used personality assessment tool that categorizes individuals into one of 16 personality types. It was developed by psychometricians Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers, based on theories by psychologist Carl Jung. The MBTI measures four dichotomies of personality: extraversion versus introversion, sensing versus intuition, thinking versus feeling, and judging versus perceiving. Each individual's unique combination of these categories results in a specific personality type, represented by a four-letter code. The test aim is to understand and explain differences among people, such as how they perceive the world and make decisions. The utility of the MBTI lies mainly in its applications for personal development, career planning, team building, and conflict management. However, its validity and reliability have been questioned within the psychological academia due to its typological nature and lack of empirical evidence. While some proponents assert it can offer valuable insights, others argue that its binary categorizations oversimplify the complexity of human personality.
