The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was passed by the United States Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush on January 8, 2002. The NCLB is a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, which aimed to improve all public schools' educational provisions, particularly for disadvantaged students. NCLB marked a significant step in federal involvement in primary and secondary education. While its bipartisan passage by both houses was impressive, the act has remained controversial for its focus on standardized testing and accountability measures. Proponents lauded that it held schools more accountable for educating all students, while critics argued that it led to a narrowed curriculum and increased pressure on teachers.
