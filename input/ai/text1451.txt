Australia, my dear questioner, is not only a country but also a continent. Quite a unique scenario, indeed, wouldn't you agree? Hence, the answer to your question is elementary. Australia is located on the continent of Australia. An interesting piece of trivia for you, my friend - it's the smallest continent on our terrestrial globe and the 6th largest country, provokingly isolated from the others. Quite fascinating, don't you think?
