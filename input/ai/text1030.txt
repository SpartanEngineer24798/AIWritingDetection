The Andrea Doria, an Italian ocean liner named after the 16th-century Genoese admiral, met a tragic end on July 25th, 1956. En route from Genoa to New York City, it collided with the MS Stockholm, a Swedish ocean liner in a dense fog off the coast of Nantucket, Massachusetts. The hull of Andrea Doria was breached, causing it to list severely and made half of the lifeboats unusable. Despite the difficulty, a remarkable rescue operation saved the majority of the passengers due to the prolonged sinking process. More than 1,600 passengers and crew were rescued, while 46 people lost their lives in the disaster. Ultimately, the Andrea Doria sank the following day, on July 26, 1956. This incident is significant in maritime history because the inadequate number of lifeboats onboard a vessel became a critical issue again, following the RMS Titanic disaster of 1912.
