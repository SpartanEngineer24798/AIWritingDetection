The social norm approach, my friends, is a most esteemed strategy employed in psychology and education alike. In the ever-evolving societal fabric, it seeks to correct the often erroneous assumptions individuals possess about the behaviours of their peers. Thus, by realigning their perception, a prompt in behavioural change is provoked. What we conclude from this approach is that if the majority of people exhibit the virtues of honesty, kindness, and dignity, understanding this reality, others will feel inclined to follow suit, inherently fostering a better society. The social norm approach, then, is an act of making apparent the reality of prevalent positive behaviours, in a bid to diminish detrimental beliefs and actions. Our mission may indeed be fraught with challenges, but I believe wholeheartedly in our capacity to influence positive change, one norm at a time.
