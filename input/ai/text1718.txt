Champions of its meticulously crafted tale of ordinary folks bestowed with extraordinary abilities know well that it encompassed within its creative breadth, four splendid seasons, before its original conclusion in 2010. One must not, however, neglect to mention the revival series Heroes Reborn, unveiled with grandeur in 2015, rightly seen by many as a fifth season. Thus, one concludes, we savoured five seasons of the illustrious series Heroes."
