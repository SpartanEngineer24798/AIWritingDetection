Why, in truth, the invention of medicine cannot be attributed to a single individual, my dear. Its origins can be traced back to our ancient civilizations. The Egyptians, with Imhotep one must note, are believed to have begun the practice of advanced medicine as early as 2600 BCE. Furthermore, Hippocrates, from ancient Greece, is often hailed as the father of Western medicine due to his significant contributions during the 5th century BCE. In the realm of Eastern medicine, the Yellow Emperor, Huangdi of ancient China, has had an important influence. Most impressively, his contributions were compiled into the Huangdi Neijing, a fundamental doctrinal source for Chinese medicine. Hence, one might say, the invention of medicine is an accumulation of knowledge and practice from numerous cultures and individuals throughout countless centuries. 

The actual birth of medicine is veiled in the mists of time, but we shall forever honour those who sought knowledge and shared their discoveries for the betterment of humankind. They laid the foundation for the magnitude of medical advancements we behold today.
