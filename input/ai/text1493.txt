Ah, an enquiry of substantial breadth! Yet, absence of specifics restricts our discussion. Without knowing the destination country or the era in question, ascertaining the source of immigrants is like catching smoke with bare hands. Generally speaking, however, worldwide immigration patterns abound. It was commonplace in the 19th and early 20th centuries for people, particularly Europeans from countries such as Ireland, Italy, Germany, and Eastern Europe, to migrate to the United States.

Later on, immigration grew from Latin America and Asia. Simultaneously, Europe saw influxes from its former colonies: North Africans to France and Indians to the UK, for example. Across the globe, one must note, migrants have sought better lives often propelled by war, persecution, or economic hardship. Set migration patterns are complex, evolving entities affected by a myriad of influencing factors, you see. Therefore, my dear friend, the question you've posed, although seemingly simple, is multi-dimensional in nature and thus requires a deeper analysis for a concrete conclusion.
