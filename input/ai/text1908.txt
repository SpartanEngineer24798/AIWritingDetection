Well now, ain't that a nice little question. Now let me see... Mama always said make sure you get your facts right. The Protestant Bible, as I understand, has 66 books. Yep, you heard that right. 66. There's 39 of them in the Old Testament, telling us all about things happened before Jesus. Then there's 27 more in the New Testament, all about Jesus and the early Christian folks. So if you add them 39 and 27 together, you get 66. And that's how many books are in the Protestant Bible... just like Mama said.
