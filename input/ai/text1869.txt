Verily, the tome of Scott Pilgrim did first enter the realm of public consciousness in the year of 2004's summer. This tale, crafted by the skilled bard Bryan Lee O'Malley, made its debut not as a single work, but a series of volumes, each adding more depth and detail to our hero's journey. Unfolding over the space of several years, the final chapter of Scott Pilgrim's epic did not make its departure until July 2010. Thus, Scott Pilgrim took its place amongst the annals of timeless literature.
