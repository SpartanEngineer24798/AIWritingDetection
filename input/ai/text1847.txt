Potholes, dread of the diligent carriage driver and bane of the unwary pedestrian, are often times the work of none other than water, man’s humble helper turned devious destroyer in this modest tale. First, beneath the commonly trodden road, in the very soil itself, a crack chances to form, perhaps wearied from the ceaseless tread of heavy wheels and iron-shod hooves, or from the ceaseless press of time itself. Over this, the skies pour their ageless tears, droplets trickling into the fault, bringing a cold touch to the once indifferent earth. Seasons pass and the winter brings his cold and ruthless grasp. Water caught in the fissure is forced to expand, widening the crack with an icy, implacable hand. Thus, erosion, that timeless artist, begins its cruel work. With the break of spring, the ice hath retreated, leaving naught but a void in its wake. The hearty foundations of road, stone, or gravel, lacking the earth’s steady support, collapse under the unwavering march of tyres and hooves. And so, much like great kingdoms of yore, the path underfoot crumbles, and a pothole both treacherous and unsightly is born.
