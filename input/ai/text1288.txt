Lo and behold, in the year of our Lord two thousand and five, there sprang forth a creation most amusing, titled “Everybody Hates Chris.” Conceived by the minds of that notable jester Chris Rock and his collaborator Ali LeRoi, this jest was spun for the masses upon the stage of the television. Many a moon did pass, from the year two thousand and five to the year two thousand and nine, during which this tale of youthful tribulations, family bonds, and mirthful misunderstandings did play out. In verily, a total of four seasons graced the eyes and ears of the audience before this spectacle did take its final bow. Thus, was the creation of "Everybody Hates Chris."
