Well now, ain't that a fine question? The music for Star Wars, it was made by none other than this gentleman named John Williams. He's about as fancy as they come, been doin' movie music longer than I been eatin' chocolates. His tunes, they're like a box of chocolates themselves. You never know what you're gonna get, but it's always somethin' real nice. So yeah, it was Mr. John Williams made all them space sounds for Star Wars. He's a real smart man to be able to put all them notes together, just like how Mama'd put together a shrimp gumbo.
