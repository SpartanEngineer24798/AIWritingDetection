In the year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred and eighty-eight, was George Washington, of noble countenance and esteemed nature, unanimously chosen to hold the lofty title of the first President of our fair United States. Not one vote cast against him, a feat yet to be repeated in the annals of our collective history. This election, held most dear in our collective remembrance, bestowed unto this man of great fortitude, the profound obligation to oversee our nascent republic, yon fertile land from sea to shining sea. And thus, the mantle fell upon the broad shoulders of our beloved George, forever marking fourth score and eighth year of the 18th-century as the time when our nation found its first helmsman. His reign began on the thirtieth day of the month of April in the year of our Lord seventeen hundred and eighty-nine when he took the oath of office in the city of New York. A moment of history, nevermore to be forgotten.
