My dear Watson, as the esteemed detective that I am, I deal with facts and deductive reasoning, not unwarranted conjectures and apocalyptic prophecies. Time, date, or any other specific detail about the hypothetical end of the world is beyond the limits of my - or anyone's - knowledge. The question ventures into the realms of divine providence or the unpredictable nature of globally catastrophic events, areas I must admit I am ill-equipped to address. Now, if you were to ask about a matter rooted in evidence-based analysis, I would be most obliged to offer my insight.
