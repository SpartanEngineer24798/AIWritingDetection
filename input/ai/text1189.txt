A timing belt is like a big rubber band inside your car's engine. It keeps everything moving in time like in a dance. It makes sure that the engine's valves open and close at the correct times during each cylinder's intake and exhaust strokes. If the timing belt breaks, the engine parts won't move right and the car won't run properly. It can also cause damage to the engine. That's why it's really important to make sure the timing belt is always in good shape.
