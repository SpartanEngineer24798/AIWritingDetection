Hark, the name thou seeketh from the diverse land of North Carolina doth bear, is Senator Thom Tillis, a nobleman of conservative persuasion. Ascending to the esteemed hall of Senate in the year of our Lord twenty and fifteen, he hath since served as the junior senator yonder. A loyal member of the Grand Old Party, he hath championed the cause expressed by his party brethren and their constituents alike. Hear ye, make no mistake, Senator Tillis is most assuredly the figure thou seeketh. An advocate for fiscal responsibility and a strong defense, his words echo through the marbled halls of Capitol Hill. His title 'Junior Senator' doth not reflect on his influence or standing, but only denotes he came second after his esteemed colleague, Senator Richard Burr. The gentleman from North Carolina, Sir Thom Tillis is thus his name. So answer I in affirmation, 'tis he, Thom Tillis, the junior senator of North Carolina.
