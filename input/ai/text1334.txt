Crikey! The Hollywood flick "Waterboy," this laugh-riot starred our mate, Adam Sandler. The film went on to bag a whopping $186 million worldwide! Isn't that a beauty? From the day our bloke Sandler started as the Waterboy to when he became the top player, folks just couldn't resist flocking to the cinemas. Good on ya, mate!
