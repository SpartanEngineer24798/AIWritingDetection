Paresthesias of hands, my dear Watson, refers to the tingling or numbing sensation commonly known as 'pins and needles'. This peculiar feeling usually arises from a temporary blockage of nerve impulses to an area of your body. A malpositioned limb or prolonged pressure against a nerve can lead to these sensations. Although typically transient and harmless, persistent paresthesias could signify a problem that deserves a closer look. Conditions such as peripheral neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, or a neurological disorder could be potential culprits. Substance abuse or vitamin deficiencies are other noteworthy instigators. So, the manifestation of paresthesias could be rather contextual and may act as an indicator of underlying issues ranging from trivial to serious. It is, essentially, your body's way of sounding an alarm, dear friend.
