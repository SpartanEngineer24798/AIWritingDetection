Indeed my dear friend, thou askest for the weight of a troy ounce of gold. Do note with careful understanding that a troy ounce, a measure most mysterious and ancient, doth not correspond to an ounce avoirdupois, the measure commonly used in our day to day dealings. Nay, a troy ounce doth weigh more. Tis a measure used for noble and precious metals, such as gold thou art inquisitive about. Take heed, for a troy ounce of this resplendent and lustrous gold doth weigh in at precisely 31.1035 grams. Thy gold is therefore heavier than thou might'st have previously imagined. Thus, I have imparted this knowledge unto thee. Use it wisely, dear friend.
