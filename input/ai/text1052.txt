Maryland falls under the jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. This federal level appellate court hears cases from several states including Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. However, within the state itself, Maryland has its own system of state courts. The intermediate appellate court in Maryland is the Court of Special Appeals, whereas the court of last resort is the Maryland Court of Appeals. Maryland also has several circuit courts which are the main trial courts for major cases, both civil and criminal. These circuit courts are located in each of Marylandâ€™s 23 counties and Baltimore City.
