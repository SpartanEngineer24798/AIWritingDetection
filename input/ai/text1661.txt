My dear subject, a Ham Station, also known as Amateur Radio Service, is required by U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations to transmit its call sign in English after 10 minutes and at the end of their communication. This practice, in the spirit of gentlemanly conduct and decorum, aids in the proper identification and consequent transparency during operation. These regulations identify the operator's station, providing an element of security and regulation to the communications. After 10 minutes or less, one should share their call sign to maintain a respectful, organised and lawful operation. A broadcaster ignoring this requirement risks retribution from the authorities. Thus, I strongly motivate abiding by these providences to foster a safe, organised and harmonious transmission environment, and remember, we are not amused by misconduct.
