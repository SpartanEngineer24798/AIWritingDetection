Scientist believe a long time ago, about 4.5 billion years ago, when the earth was still very young, something big, like another planet, hit earth really hard. This huge crash caused a lot of rocks and stuff to fly away from earth into the sky. This flying stuff started moving around the earth in a circle (orbiting) due to earth's gravity. Over time, this stuff started sticking together and eventually formed our moon. So, the moon is like a little brother or sister to earth, as it was born from the earth itself. Now isn't that cool?
