Crikey! Four Loko, mate, is an alcoholic beverage originated from the United States. It's a combination of malt liquor and caffeine, providing you with a bit of a kick! The drink was notorious when it first came out – people often referred to it as "blackout in a can" because of its high alcohol content and stimulating effects. But keep in mind, legend, that it’s been slightly tamed down since 2010 when they removed the caffeine, guarana, and taurine after being scrutinized by the FDA. Still packs a punch, though, with fruity flavors like watermelon, peach, and gold. It's a wild one, ain't it? But remember, always enjoy your drinks responsibly. Be safe out there, mate!
