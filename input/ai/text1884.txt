The Royal Standard, emblematic of regal authority in Britain, unfurls its majestic panoply only thee times upon the whims of fate we, mortals, cannot sway. Firstly, it soars, an avian celebrity above Her Majesty's royal abodes, a harbinger of the Queen's very existence within the hallowed halls of Buckingham Palace, Windsor Castle, or Sandringham House. Second, it graces state occasions and official engagements, a silent sentinel bearing witness to radiant processions and solemn ceremonies. Lastly, it takes to the air upon royal vessels, an indomitable flag in the face of the tempestuous sea, reflecting the indomitable spirit of Britain's monarchy. Verily, the Royal Standard is not flown bereft of the Queen, its symbolic radiance inherently linked to Her Majesty. It is the celestial muse, ever vigilant and ever present in times of regal sojourn, devotedly mirroring the movements of the monarchy to the denizens of the realm.
