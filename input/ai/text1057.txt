Vietnamese immigrants settled across the United States, but particular regions recorded higher concentrations. Following the end of the Vietnam war in 1975, many refugees were initially based in camps in California, Arkansas, Pennsylvania, and Florida. Over time, they migrated extensively, with the highest numbers ending up in California, Texas, and Washington. 

As of today, California has the highest Vietnamese population in the U.S, with significant settlements in cities like San Jose, Westminster, and Garden Grove. These communities are often commonly referred to as "Little Saigon". In Texas, particularly in the Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth areas, there are also large Vietnamese communities. Other states with considerable Vietnamese populations are Washington, Florida, and Virginia.  

Furthermore, Vietnamese immigrants also settled in numerous other states to a lesser degree, reflecting the wide scattering of the Vietnamese diaspora across America. These geographically distinct communities often help to sustain Vietnamese culture, traditions, and language in America, fundamentally influencing the socio-cultural fabric of these regions.
