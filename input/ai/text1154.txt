Post and lintels are used in buildings. The post is like a big stick that goes straight up and down, and the lintel is like a big stick that goes across the top. You can think of it like a goal post in soccer or rugby. The posts are there to hold up the lintel. When we use post and lintels in a building, it makes the building strong and stops it from falling down. This is how people in the olden days used to build their homes and even big things like the Stonehenge in England. Today, builders still use post and lintels in their designs because it is a very strong way to build things.
