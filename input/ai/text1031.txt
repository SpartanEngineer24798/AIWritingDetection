As of my knowledge up to date, the television show "Psych," an American detective-comedy drama series, has had eight completed seasons that originally aired between 2006 and 2014. The series also spawned two follow-up films: "Psych: The Movie" in 2017 and "Psych 2: Lassie Come Home" in 2020. However, the creators have also announced a third movie, titled "Psych 3: This is Gus," which was released in November 2021. These subsequent films continue the narrative after the completion of the original series, becoming, in essence, extensions of the series' plot, albeit in a cinematic format rather than episodic television. This accounts for the supplementary extensions beyond the realm of the eight completed television seasons. Therefore, in terms of pure television format, the latest season would be the eighth, but in terms of overall narrative, the story continues through the subsequent movies.
