Well, you see, it's this lady named Stefka Kostadinova from Bulgaria. Now, if you ain't never heard of Bulgaria, don't worry, it's a little country over yonder in Europe. Anyhow, she jumped so high, it's like she had wings or somethin'. It was back in 1987, during the World Championships in Rome. Now Rome, that's in Italy, just so you know. And she jumped 2.09 meters. Now I ain't good with the metric system so I had to look up - that's bout 6 feet and 10 inches! Imagine that! Most men can't jump that high, let alone a lady. And you know what else? Her record still stands to this day. Nobody has jumped higher than her, not even close. Ain't that somethin'? That's all I got to say about that.
