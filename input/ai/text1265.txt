A truth be told in iambic verse, fair Sidney Crosby, a name of hockey's fame, came to the Penguins, his star to nurse, in manner of a Draft Lottery game. In the year of two thousand and five, the pucks did fall betwixt the leagues of ice, and the names of youth in drafted strive, vied for the chance to roll the dice.

This Draft Lottery, a spectacle rare, held in such a year as dispute had made, saw the Penguins with fortune fair, and Crosby's future with them was laid. For the blessed bards of lottery's grace, did cast their lots and the Penguins won. Their prize, a lad with a swift fleet pace, bright Sidney Crosby, second to none.

Such was the way the Penguins claimed, their star of ice with a golden name. Employed not by trade or by wealth gained, but by chance's hand in a lottery game. Thus Sidney Crosby, a Penguin true, on frozen fields his fame did ensue.
