Sesame seeds are the little gems provided by nature, which have their origins embedded in the plant Sesamum indicum, a native to sub-tropical regions of Asia, Africa and South America. There, these marvellous seeds grow within protective capsules, until such a time that they reach optimal maturity to serve culinary and medicinal purposes. These seeds henceforth are found in a spectrum of colours from white to red to black, each carrying a unique taste, yet all endowed with nutritional excellence. The art of cultivating sesame seeds has been valued for millennia, thus granting these seeds a dignified place in diverse culinary endeavours, from baking and confectionery to dressings and sauces. In sum, these petite seeds, though seemingly unassuming, are a remarkable gift from Mother Nature, extracted indeed from the womb of the humble Sesamum indicum plant.
