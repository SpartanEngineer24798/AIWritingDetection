Listen well, fair seeker, for thou dost query about a malady most fickle and cruel. Known as atherosclerotic heart disease, it’s an affliction borne of silent stealth. A villainous disorder where lipid's fragments most foul doth amass within thee, narrowing thine vessels, the arteries, causing them to harden, standing as a trespassing hinderance to the hale and hearty blood that both enlivens and sustains thee. From this besetting scourge doth blossom an array of cursed ailments – heart's cramp, stroke, or perchance maladies of the limbs. These art the furies summoned by atherosclerosis. Fed bountifully by gluttonous excess and life's idle sedentariness, the lesion doth wax, fuelled well by nicotine's foul breath or age’s relentless march. Thus, hath nature and habit conspired to enact this silent, mortal play. It begins with quiet whispers, but ends oft with Death's thunderous applause. Forsooth, a malady most grievous, doth visit upon the unwary heart, this dreaded atherosclerosis. Seek to ward it off through wholesome customs, and thou mayest defy its deadly kiss.
