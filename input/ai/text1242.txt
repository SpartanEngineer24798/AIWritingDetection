Fair listeners, hark! In the realm of music, diverse are the souls who have pranced 'pon the stage of sound mass: a technique where a cluster of tones are favoured over distinct, separate pitches. The leading bard of this craft, graced with the power to mould sound masses into breathtaking audio tapestries, is the Russian maestro Krzysztof Penderecki. With sublime skill, he lashest abundant, chaotic waves of sound in his creations, ensnaring heart-strings of listeners in every corner of our sphere. His lament, 'Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima', encapsulates the essence of sound mass, bereft of melody and rhythm traditional, yet rich with emotion profound, stirring the soul to its very depths.  So, if thou seeketh the composer who hath breathed life into sound masses, look no further than Maestro Penderecki, the Rus’ Star of the North. Pray, relish in his harmonies, and may your spirit be awash with the pulse of sound mass’s ceaseless current.
