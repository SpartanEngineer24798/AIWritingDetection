Well, dear Watson, a celestial body can be categorically classified as a Dwarf planet if it meets a distinct set of criteria: It must orbit the sun, must have sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces and assume a hydrostatic equilibriumâ€”practically, it means to have a near-round shape. It must not clear the neighbourhood around its orbit, i.e. it shares its orbit with other celestial bodies. The international astronomical community considers, for instance, our well-known Pluto, Eris, and Ceres as dwarf planets. Notably, these diminutive entities differ from planets due to their inability to clear their orbit, and from smaller celestial bodies, due to their sufficient size to attain that spherical shape. So, while they remain intriguing anomalies, dwarf planets hold a distinct position in our cosmic interpretation.
