Soy is derived from the soybean plant, scientifically known as Glycine max. It's a species of legume and is native to East Asia. This versatile plant is used to manufacture a wide variety of products. A significant portion of soybeans grown worldwide is processed for its oil, but it is also a primary component in the creation of several food products including tofu, soy milk, soy sauce, and textured vegetable protein. Certain fermented soy products like tempeh and miso are also well-known, particularly in Asian cuisine. Soybeans also comprise the main ingredient in a multitude of non-food products such as biofuel, animal feed, and even certain types of ink and crayons. Notably, soybeans are very high in protein, making them a crucial dietary element, particularly in vegetarian and vegan diets. Their high protein content and versatility in product creation have made soybeans a commodity with global significance. Comprehending the life cycle of the soybean, its protein content, and its various applications constitutes a valuable aspect of understanding our globalized food system.
