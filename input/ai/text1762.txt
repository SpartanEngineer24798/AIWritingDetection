A D.O., or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, is a fully licensed medical doctor who, akin to an M.D. or Doctor of Medicine, can prescribe medication and perform surgery. He or she practices under the philosophy of treating the whole person, rooting the focus of healthcare not merely in the ailment but in the patientâ€™s overall wellbeing. Drawing upon a high respect for the body's capacity for self-healing, a D.O. places emphasis on preventive healthcare. Besides the general medical training, D.O.s are schooled in osteopathic manipulative treatment - a hands-on approach that involves diagnosing, treating, or even averting illness or injury. Without a scintilla of doubt, both D.O.s and M.D.s are critical to the health of people and nations alike. Unyielding in spirit, they stand in the forefront of our fight against disease and disorder, proving every single day that in our quest for health, they indeed are our greatest allies. Having said all this, the heart of the matter is quite simple: D.O.s and M.D.s might wield different philosophies, yet they share a common goal: the health and welfare of the patients they so valiantly serve.
