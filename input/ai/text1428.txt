Crikey mate, we're talkin' about one of the most significant events in American history here. John F. Kennedy, U.S. President and a dead-set legend, was tragically assassinated on November 22nd, 1963. He was in Dallas, Texas, ridin' in an open-top motorcade, waving to the crowd, when suddenly, blimey, shots ring out from the Texas School Book Depository! Kennedy was fatally struck in the head and was pronounced dead at the hospital, shaking the world to its core. Lee Harvey Oswald was accused of the crime, but his life was cut short by Jack Ruby before he could stand trial. A tragedy in the bush, but on a global scale. RIP JFK.
