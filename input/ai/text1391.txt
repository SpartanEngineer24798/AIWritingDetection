Crikey! Uncle Sam, to the American people, represents their government and the United States as a whole, a symbol of patriotism and public spirit, right! He's depicted as an old man with white hair, a goatee and dressed in red, white and blue. First popularized during the War of 1812, the term, Uncle Sam, has its roots from Samuel Wilson, a meat packer who supplied barrels of beef to the U.S. Army, marked with 'U.S.' Becoming known as Uncle Sam's, the soldiers related it to their country, the United States. Over time, political cartoonists added their touch, giving Uncle Sam his iconic look. He symbolises freedom, power and American values. As a cultural icon, Uncle Sam helps Americans feel a sense of national identity. Heâ€™s not just a mascot, he brings a sense of unity and pride. In a word, he's the embodiment of what the yanks believe in and stand for!
