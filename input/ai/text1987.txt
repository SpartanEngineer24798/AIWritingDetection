Well now, Dungeness crabs, you gonna find 'em on the west coast of North America, from the chilly waters of Alaska's Aleutian Islands all the way down to California's Santa Cruz. They make their homes in the sand and mud at the bottom of the ocean, from the low tide line to about 200 fathoms deep. They got this name 'cause they was first discovered in Dungeness, Washington. They're pretty special critters, I gotta say, with their wide, long body and sweet, tender meat. Folks enjoy catchin' them for a good meal. My mama always said, "Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get." But if you're fishing for Dungeness crab, you're in for a real treat.
