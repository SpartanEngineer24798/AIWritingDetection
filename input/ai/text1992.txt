Well now, Humboldt KS is right smack dab in the middle of our great country, in a place they call Kansas. More exact like, it's in the southeast part of Kansas. Ain't nothing like the flat plains, the waving wheat, and the big, wide open sky of Kansas. Humboldt is a small town, right cozy like, tucked between Iola and Chanute. Now if you get on that road they call Highway 169, you'd be heading straight for it. So thatâ€™s all I have to say about that.
