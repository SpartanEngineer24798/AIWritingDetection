My Dear Fellow Citizens,

I declare to thee that the Canadian Citizenship Test is a stepping stone into the world of Canada's glory. The test, my friends, is a written examination, made up of typical 20 questions, set from a pool of questions designed by the Canadian Government. Each question aims at evaluating one's knowledge about Canada, including its history, cultures, laws, and rights.

Put forth in a multiple-choice format, the subjects contained in the span of these questions include the country's political history, national and historical facts and symbols, geographical information, and the rights and responsibilities of a citizen.

The test is generally conducted in either of our official languages, English or French. However, if you'd prove to be at a disadvantage due to linguistic limitations or diagnosed disabilities, it may be offered in the format of an oral test with a citizenship officer.

Remember, my friends, to pass this test you require a score of 75 percent or higher. God speed, roll your sleeves up and dive into the rich depths of Canadian knowledge.
