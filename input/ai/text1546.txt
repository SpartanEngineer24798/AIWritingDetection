Alongside my pipe and violin, I have found time to study the workings of commerce, Watson. A direct marketing channel, dear fellow, is a pathway free from intermediaries, that companies use to sell their goods or services directly to consumers. These pathways may manifest in various forms; think of an online store, a mail-order catalog, even doorstep selling if you will. The clear advantage is the absence of ‘middlemen’ – retailers or distributors – allowing for greater command over product pricing, brand image, and customer relationships. But remember, Watson, keeping track of customer fulfilment, managing inventory and handling promotions are tasks that now fall squarely in the lap of the company. A rewarding strategy if executed correctly, yet one not devoid of its trials and tribulations.
