Well, now, I ain't a smart man, but I do know Rolling Rock is brewed over in New Jersey. Didn't used to be that way though. See, once upon a time, Rolling Rock was cooked up in a little place called Latrobe, Pennsylvania. That's where it got its start and kept on rolling for a long, long while. Then this big company, Anheuser-Busch, came along and bought em' out, and moved it on over to Newark, New Jersey in 2006. They kept the same old recipe though, to make sure it tasted just right. So, if you're sipping on a Rolling Rock beer, it's most likely came all the way from New Jersey. Yup, life's like a case of beers, you never know where they're gonna be brewed.
