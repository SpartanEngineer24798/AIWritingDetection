Use taxes are essentially consumption taxes imposed on consumers for the usage, storage, or consumption of goods and services that have not been taxed at the point of sale. Frequently, this occurs when items are purchased in one state, but used in another where no sales tax was levied at the point of sale. The aim of this tax is to protect local sellers who would otherwise be undermined by purchases from tax-free jurisdictions. It's a form of harmonisation, adjusting for disparities in sales tax between different regions, and discouraging individuals from evading local taxes by purchasing goods in lower-taxed areas. In essence, a use tax ensures fair competition, seeks revenue equality and aims to maintain the financial vitality of a jurisdiction. As citizens, it is our duty to contribute to the collective pot for the betterment of society. We may not like taxes, but as I once said, "We contend that for a nation to try to tax itself into prosperity is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by the handle." And yet, it remains a necessary duty.
