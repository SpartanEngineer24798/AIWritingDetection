My dear interlocutor, The Waterboy, a diverting portrayal of American sport and quirky humour, starring the delightfully eccentric Adam Sandler, has indeed been a triumphant success. As per sovereign authority of box office statistics, my loyal subjects inform me that this comedic event of the silver screen has generated a stunning sum of approximately 185 million US dollars globally. A splendid tally for a feature of such playful deportment, wouldn't you agree?
