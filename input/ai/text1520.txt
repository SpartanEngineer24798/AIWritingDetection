My dear interlocutor, it would be quite simple to deduce that the official currency of Puerto Rico is indeed the US Dollar. The reason being that Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States. As a result, their economic system operates within that of the United States, leading to the use of the same currency. Therefore, when trading, or purchasing in the markets of San Juan, one would do so using the wares of Washington, or rather, the US dollar. Quite elementary, indeed.
