Thin film technology is a branch of material science that involves depositing ultra-thin layers, often less than one micrometre thick, of materials onto a substrate. These films can be composed of distinct types of materials, including metals, semiconductors, or insulators. The technology is used in a wide range of applications, for example, in electronic and optical components, solar panels, and anti-reflective coatings. Methods of depositing these thin-films include but are not limited to, chemical vapor deposition and physical vapor deposition. The unique characteristics of these thin films are primarily due to the quantum effects that become prominent at the microscopic scale, resulting in distinctive electrical, optical, and mechanical properties. By manipulating these properties, researchers can utilize these thin films to support and advance various technological fields.
