The SATA, or Serial ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment), power connector is a 15-pin plug used to power up hard disks, solid state drives (SSDs), and optical drives like Blu-rays, DVDs, and CDs. Unlike the older Molex power connectors, the SATA power connector, introduced in the early 2000s, is smaller in size, has better anchorage to the drive, and can only be inserted one way, limiting the probability of mistakes. This connector carries 3.3V, 5V, and 12V lines. It is an upgrade from the earlier-used Parallel ATA (PATA). This new system enables faster data transfer rates, improved airflow within the PC's casing due to smaller cable sizes, and efficient transfer protocol. Thus, SATA power connectors aid in establishing better performing and simpler internal storage device connections.
