In football, the "defensive line" is a group of players who have a very important job. Their main purpose is to stop the other team from moving the ball forward and scoring. They stay at the front and directly face the offensive line of the opposing team. The defensive line consists of different positions including defensive tackles and defensive ends. They are the first line of defense and they try their best to block the other team's offensive plays by tackling the quarterback or stopping the running back. So in short, the defensive line is like the superheroes of the team, always protecting their side from the opponents.
