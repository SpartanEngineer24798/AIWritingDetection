Anon, dear friend, the year of our Lord, sixteen hundred seven did mark the birth of Jamestown, the first English settlement of enduring kind in the New World. A bold venture, forsooth, of the Virginia Company of London, driven by dreams of gold and a passage to the Indies. Yea, on the shores of what is now Virginia, these adventurous souls did lay their claim, naming their new home in honour of their sovereign, James I. Known not for its tranquillity, but for its hardships and trials, the establishment of Jamestown marked the genesis of what we now know as the great nation of America. So it was, in the annals of history, Jamestown was colonized in the year 1607.
