In the first two films of the Harry Potter series, namely "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" and "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets", the role of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore was portrayed splendidly by Richard Harris, an actor of Irish dissent. It was quite unfortunate indeed when Harris passed on in 2002, creating an unexpected vacant spot for this pivotal character.

Subsequently, a talented actor from Northern Ireland, one Michael Gambon, was passed the mantle, who then brought life and depth to Dumbledore's character in the rest of the series. Gambon's portrayal was filled with both the required gravitas and captivating charm, aligning quite well with the character's essence mentioned in the books. It feels rather like an illustrious and majestic wizard out of one of my Middle-earth tales! Thus, it was Richard Harris first, and then Michael Gambon who played the revered Headmaster of Hogwarts.
