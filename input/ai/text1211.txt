A 28 day cycle usually refers to the menstrual cycle of a woman, which on average lasts for about 28 days. But, it could also refer to anything that happens regularly every 28 days. For example, our body's immune system has a 28-day cycle. It also may suggest the lunar cycle. This is the time it takes for the moon to go around the earth. If you look at the moon at night, you might see a crescent moon or a full moon. That's part of the lunar cycle. Remember, not everything with a 28 day cycle is visible or noticeable to us, but they are really important for nature and for humans too.
