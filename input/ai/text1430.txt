Crikey mate! In the midst of World War II, the Battle of Iwo Jima, a real rough and tumble showdown between the U.S. and Japan, began on February 19th, 1945. The objective for the U.S. forces was to gain control of the island and its airfields to allow for a base close to the Japanese mainland. Now, this ferocious fight didn't wrap up until and around 36 days later, on March 26th, 1945. That's just over a month, if you thought of it in crocodile terms, that would be a long, long fight in the wild. Despite the victory, it was a harsh one, with a high number of casualties on both sides, reminds us all that war is a dangerous game, just like wrangling crocs.
