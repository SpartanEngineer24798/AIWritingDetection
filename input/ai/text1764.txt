Ho Chi Minh, a prolific figure in the Vietnam War, was the leader of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, or North Vietnam. His dedication was to the cause of Vietnamese nationalism, borne from years of colonial subjugation under the French. An ardent communist, Minh sought support from the Soviet Union and China to expunge foreign influence. Thus, he became the face of resistance against the U.S., intensifying the Vietnam War. Despite being western-educated, his stand was against the domineering tide of Western political ideologies in Asia, sparking a fierce war of attrition with the U.S. and its South Vietnamese allies. His resolve to unite Vietnam under his leadership, however disagreeable as it was seen in Western eyes, was unyielding. In summary, Minh was the fulcrum around which revolved an epochal struggle that reshaped the geopolitical landscape of Southeast Asia.
