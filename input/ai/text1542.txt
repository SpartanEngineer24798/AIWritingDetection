Elementary, my dear user. The man currently holding the prestigious title of Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court is none other than John G. Roberts Jr. He's been occupying the position since 2005, following his appointment by President George W. Bush. Educated at Harvard, Roberts has proven his legal acuity time and again. Despite our current climate of ideological disparity, he strives to lead the Court towards greater consensus. As Holmes would say, the examination of shadows and footprints left behind by history is essential in understanding the present man, and in Roberts' case, it's resoundingly clear that he designs to harmonize the Court's judgments.
