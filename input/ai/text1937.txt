Well now, the "Bad Girls Club" is like this here American tele-visor show, you might have seen it on the Oxygen network, yes sirree. The show's all about them young lasses from all cross the country, who're thought to have some attitude problems and heavy tempers. Yes sir, these ladies are known as real "bad girls."

Each season, a handful of these girls get chosen to live together in a luxurious mansion for some months, trying to change their issues while living by certain rules. But ain't nothing smooth here, cause quite often, there's fussin', feudin', and fightin'. 

Now these girls, they're from all walks of life. You might see a bartender, a model, an artist, or even a mother. The show's been on for some 17 seasons, and that'd make just about hundreds of "bad girls." Some of these names I recollect are Tanisha Thomas, Natalie Nunn, and Rocky Santiago. But, like Mama always did say, "Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get," and that right there is true for the girls of "Bad Girls Club" too.
