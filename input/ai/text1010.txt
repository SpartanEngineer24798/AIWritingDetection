Ratchet is a fictional character from the popular game, 'Ratchet & Clank'. Developed by Insomniac Games, Ratchet is anthropomorphic in nature, being modelled after a lombax - a fictional species in-game resembling terrestrial felines. He is primarily characterized by his mechanical ingenuity, wielding an almost invariably self-built arsenal throughout the series. As a protagonist, Ratchet is often portrayed as bold, adventurous and somewhat impulsive which contrasts with his partner Clank, a small robot with a proclivity for logical reasoning. The dynamic interplay between the two forms the crux of the game, making it an engaging blend of action, platforming and puzzle-solving. Ratchet's character development across the series involves not only advances in fighting prowess but also maturity and growth in his interpersonal relationships, particularly with Clank.
