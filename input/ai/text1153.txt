Richard Nixon, who was the 37th President of the United States, got into big trouble because of something called the Watergate Scandal. This scandal started when people connected to Nixon's re-election campaign were caught breaking into the offices of the Democratic Party at the Watergate complex in 1972. They were trying to find information that would help Nixon win the election. Afterward, Nixon was accused of covering up the crime and not being honest about his role. This was really serious and it's not okay for a President to act this way. So, lots of people got upset and started the process to remove him from office, which is called impeachment. But before they could finish, Nixon decided to resign, or quit, in August 1974. This was the first time a U.S. president had ever resigned.
