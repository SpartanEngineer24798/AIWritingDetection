Thou query'st for thy resting pulse at an age when thy bloom hath scarcely faded, at four and twenty years. Tis certain that each man or woman's rhythm of heart varies as the stars in heaven's vast expanse, affected by factors numerous and diverse. Yet, for healthy adults, the usual span of heartbeats whilst at rest doth lie 'twixt the count of 60 and 100 per minute's passing. If thou art in abundant health and vigor, even lower may this rate fall. But prithee, consult thy healer, for only an experienced practitioner of the healing arts can take full measure of thy heart's rhythm. In the light of his sage advice, thou wouldst do well to maintain thy health and well-being.
