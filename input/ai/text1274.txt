Verily, the melody named "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia," from the quill of the bard Bobby Russell, was first chanted by the enchanting siren Vicki Lawrence in the year of our Lord 1972. This fair lady's dulcet tones spun a grim tale of deceit and foul murder, a story as dark as the starless sky of a Georgian night. This melancholy air soon staked its claim upon the hearts and ears of the masses, ascending to the peak of Billboard's Hot 100 chart. Thus, the name Vicki Lawrence is forever etched in the annals of sound as the original songstress of "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia".
