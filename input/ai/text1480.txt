Immediately, I observe a discrepancy in your request; you refer to 'Mohammed Gandhi', which seems like a fusion of two influential figures from India: Mahatma Gandhi and Mohammed Ali Jinnah. However, assuming you meant Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, known widely as Mahatma Gandhi, he met his end through assassination at the hands of Nathuram Godse, a Hindu extremist. The incident took place on 30th January 1948, in the Birla House, New Delhi. Gandhi was on his way to a prayer meeting when Godse approached him and shot him at point-blaze range, a brutal third degree act confirming his death. Godse's resentment evolved from his perception that Gandhi was overly accommodating to demands from India's Muslim population. Thus, the tragic fate of a man of peace.
