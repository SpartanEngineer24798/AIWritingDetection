In the manner befitting of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II, I must clarify that Turkey is not within the confines of another country. In fact, it is a sovereign nation unto itself, situated at the crossroads of Europe and Asia. This proud Republic has a rich history that includes both the Byzantine and Ottoman Empires, making it rather unique. Moreover, it's a member of international cooperative entities such as NATO and G20. Furthermore, its largest city, Istanbul, is of considerable historical significance, being the erstwhile Constantinople. Thus, dear interlocutor, Turkey is no mere province but an influential country that straddles two continents in its splendour.
