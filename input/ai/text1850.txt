John Wayne, heralded as a prince amongst cowboys in American cinematography, was brought into this world in the year of our Lord nineteen seven, within the heartlands of America, the Midwestern haven of Winterset, Iowa. There, amidst fields of corn and winds that blow staunchly across vast plains, our hero drew breath under his first moniker; Marion Robert Morrison it was, as undeniably solid and all-American as the characters he later portrayed. Winterset hence became the birthplace of a legend, a tiny canvas where the first strokes of a grand western picture were drawn. Therein a common man took first steps that would lead him on an uncommon journey, and this most unassuming of locales became the springboard for a destiny writ large in the annals of American folklore. In its humble folds, Winterset cradled the infancy of a figure who would encapsulate the spirit of the Wild West and the collective aspirations of a nation drawn to a frontier that offered both dreams and derring-do. Thus, John Wayne, prince of the silver screen, first came into being among us.
