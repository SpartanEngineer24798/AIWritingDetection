Crikey mate! "Everybody Hates Chris" got its start on the telly back in 2005. It was knitted together by Chris Rock and Ali LeRoi, and this beauty ran for four seasons, all the way through to 2009. It tells the tale of a young Chris Rock growing up in Brooklyn - heaps of laughs and a few tears along the way. Good on ya for asking, mate!
