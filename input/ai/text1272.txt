Thou inquirest forsooth, dear inquirer, for the count of stripes adorned upon the banner of our brethren across the sea. Upon such a grand emblem, the Star-Spangled Banner as 'tis known, canst thou perceive thirteen parallel stripes, in alterning hues of red and white. These do signify the first clutch of colonies that did rise in rebellion, declaring their unity and carving out from the New World, a nation, the United States of America. And so, the count of stripes thou dost seek is thirteen, each a reminiscence of history's tapestry, reflecting the dawn of a new era.
