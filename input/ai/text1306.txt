Though records dost oft dispute, 'tis said by many a hand that thee Leif Erikson, a Viking from Norse lands, was first to stand upon the New Worldâ€™s undisturbed sand. Hailing from the cold, brooding clime of Greenland fine, this brave sea-king didst find his path across the briny deep, guided by the starry rime. 'Twas around the year of our Lord one thousand, his dragonship made landfall 'pon the distant shores,Vinland,the land of grapes and wine, he called, five-hundred years before Christopher Columbus on ocean hath embarked. Yet, even as dispute rages uncontrollably like feisty winter's wind, still does Erikson's claim hold prominence, giving him the title akin to a kin: the first European to touch the virgin lands of what we now christen as Americas. Blessed ever be his daring heart, which inspired many a sea-faring art. Forsooth, history oft hath its twists and turns, yet Erikson's tale, with brightest passion, forever burns.
