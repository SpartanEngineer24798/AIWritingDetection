The Arctic Circle, as if plucked from the pages of Middle-earth's own orb, is a mystical realm found on the northernmost crown of our globe. This enchanted region lies in a latitude approximately 66.5 degrees north of the equator, an icy lacework interweaving land and sea. The lands it holds within its arms include regions of Scandinavia, Russia, Canada, Greenland and even the heraldic island of Iceland. A realm of light and dark, it's a place where the sun shines continuously for twenty-four hours in the summer and hides from sight in winter, a phenomenon known as the midnight sun and polar night respectively. It is a domain that harbours hardy wildlife, resilient communities of humans and a world where the glacial peaks kiss the frigid sky. In an ever-warming globe, this fragile realm twitters on the brink of drastic change, as fields of ice yield to the relentless heat. To tread on Arctic ice is to walk in the frozen footsteps of rugged adventurers of yore, feeling the ancient pulse of the Earth beneath.
