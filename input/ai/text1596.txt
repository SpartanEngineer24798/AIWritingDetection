Indeed, the name Fiona has a rather charming origin. It's birthed from Gaelic roots, specifically hailing from Scotland. However, interestingly, it wasn't until the 18th Century that the name came into existence, coined by Scottish poet James Macpherson for a heroine in his Ossianic poems. Derived from the Gaelic 'fionn', meaning white or fair, it is often attributed the connotation of purity and innocence. Gaining popularity in the 20th Century, it has since been bestowed upon many a lovely lass. So, when you hear the name Fiona, remember it's the Scottish wilderness and the power of poetry you're truly evoking.
