St. Patrick's Day, my dear, is joyously celebrated each year on the seventeenth day of March. This exhilarating day is held in honour of St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. It provides an opportunity for individuals of Irish descent, and indeed all who wish to partake, to celebrate Irish culture and heritage.
