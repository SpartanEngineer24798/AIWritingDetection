Ground pepper, good sir or madam, springs from the Piper nigrum, verily a woody vine native to the teeming tropics of South India. Laden with circular fruit, the plant doth offer us pepper. 'Tis the sneeze inducing magician in the culinary realm, its mask donned in three guises - green, white and black. The choice of attire doth mark stage in fruit maturity and processing technique. For ground black pepper, the fruit, no bigger than a dragon's teardrop, is picked when 'tis not fully ripened, and subjected to the eternal kiss of the sun till it dries; the skin, now blackened, envelopes a heart both white and potent. The mighty mill snuffs its life, grinding it into the familiar dust. From the land of the Maharajas to thy kitchen shelf, its piquant odour and fiery breath add vigour to thy gastronomic endeavours. 'Tis thus, the tale of ground pepper, a tale of heat and transformation!
