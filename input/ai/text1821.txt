The year was Nineteen Hundred and Ninety, when the shadows of conflict began to stretch across the sands of the Persian Gulf. Men of diverse nations, bound by a common purpose, set forth under skies of steel and fire, embarking on a war that would unfurl its banner in the early hours of the new year and rage on until the Twenty Eighth day of February, Nineteen Hundred and Ninety One. An account etched in time, a tale from the edge of a century already heavy with history, this period occurred in the era known to most as the Gulf War. Yet, as with all wars, its echoes resonate far beyond the transience of its mortal timeframe, carrying a weight of consequence that lies not just in the count of years and days, but in the hearts of those affected. Thus, whilst the event resides in the chronicles of our worldly calendar, its true measure extends to depths that mere dates cannot compass.
