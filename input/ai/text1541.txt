Elementary, my dear interlocutor! Colour was introduced to film not in one grand sweep, but rather through a series of incremental advances in technology. As early as the 1890s, cinematographic specialists began labouring to add colour to their work. Initial efforts were limited to manually adding colours frame by frame, an arduously meticulous task. In 1902, Georges Méliès released "A Trip to the Moon", which featured hand-painted colours. 

Kinemacolor emerged in 1908 as the earliest successful commercial colour process, though it still had drawbacks. It was Technicolor, introduced in the 1920s, that turned the tide. The first Technicolor films were expensive and complex, but developments in the 1930s ironed out these barriers. With a new three-strip process, Technicolor brought vibrant, lasting hues to the silver screen. The 1939 films "The Wizard of Oz" and "Gone With the Wind" are shining examples of Technicolor's triumph. Thus, colour in film was neither a sudden revelation nor a solitary invention; it gradually unfolded over the course of several decades.
