Well now, I may not be a gambling man, but I do know a thing or two about cards. To make a royal flush in poker, you gotta be pretty lucky, 'cause that's the best hand you could possibly get! You first gotta be dealt five cards from the same suit, you know, like all hearts or all clubs. But not just any cards will do. They gotta be the top five - that'd be the 10, the Jack, the Queen, the King, and, the Ace. All of them, in the same suit. Now that's a royal flush! It's like having a box of chocolates and all of them being the cherry-filled kind. Mighty sweet!
