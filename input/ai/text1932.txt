Well, now, that's a funny question. Mama always told me money ain't everything, but I reckon it's pretty important to some folks. The man on the hundred dollar bill, thatâ€™s Benjamin Franklin. Yes, Sir-ree. Old man Franklin was a mighty smart man, did all kinds of things. They say he flew a kite in a thunderstorm, invented some glasses, and helped write our Constitution. Sure don't know how one man gets to do all those things. But even though he was never the president, they still put his face on the hundred dollar bill. I guess that's pretty neat.
