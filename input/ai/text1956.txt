Well, now, St. Patty, or St. Patrick as he's properly called, is a man folks in Ireland remember real fondly. You see, he lived a long time ago, round about the 5th century. Made a huge difference, he did, bringing Christianity to the Irish folks. And some say he used a shamrock, that's a lil' green plant with three leaves, to explain bout the Holy Trinity - that's Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit. Now every year, on March 17th, people all around the globe, they celebrate St. Patrick's Day. They wear green, enjoy parades, and eat good food. It's a day for honoring St. Patrick and all he did for the people of Ireland, much like how we remember good ol' George Washington on Presidents' Day. And that's all I got to say about that.
