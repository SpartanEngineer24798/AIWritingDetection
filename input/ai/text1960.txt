Well now, there's been a whole mess of folks come to this country from all over. I reckon in the early days, we had lots of folks from England, Ireland and Germany. They were escaping bad stuff like potato famines and what not. Just like my friend Bubba from Vietnam, folks came from China and Japan too, looking for a better life here. Then we got a lot of people coming from Italy, Greece and places like Poland. Oh, and I can't forget about all those nice folks from Mexico and other parts of Latin America, they been coming here for a long time, too. And then, like Lieutenant Dan's ancestors, there were those who come from places like Russia and Eastern Europe. Nowadays, we're seeing more folks from the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia. I guess what I'm trying to say is, people from pretty much everywhere have come to this great big country of ours. Itâ€™s like my momma always said, "America's like a box of chocolates. You never know where folks are gonna come from next."
