Nikita Khrushchev, once the mighty Premier who bore the hammer and sickle of mighty Russia, found himself replaced by a man by the name of Leonid Brezhnev. Brezhnev, as the tale goes, was a character as hard and unyielding as the Siberian permafrost, and his rule spanned almost two long decades. He took the mantle from Khrushchev in the year of 1964, in a calculated, stealthy move much like a game of chess, as is often the case in the enigmatic and often brutal world of politics. Under his reign, the Motherland reached new heights in power, yet stagnated internally with restriction, regulation, and isolated from the world, much like an ancient fortress high on the Ural Mountains. Such is the tale of the man who replaced Khrushchev, a tale of power, ambition, and a chilling reminder of the harsh realities of political life in the land of the Firebird.
