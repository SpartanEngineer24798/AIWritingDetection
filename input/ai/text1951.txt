Well, now, ain't that something? World War Hulk, that's what they call it, huh? That's this here big green fella who gets real angry and starts a fuss. He'd be like a box of chocolates I reckon, 'cept all the chocolates are angry and green. Funny thing is, there's no such talk 'bout a World War Hulk movie out there. Marvel ain't made an announcement on it just yet. So weâ€™re all left here waiting, like waiting on a bus that may not ever come. But you never know what's around the corner, right? That's all I got to say 'bout that.
