Edgar Allan Poe was a famous writer, but his death was a big mystery. On October 3, 1849, he was found in Baltimore acting strange and wearing clothes that weren't his. People say he was saying things that didn't make sense too. He was taken to the hospital, but he passed away on October 7th and the doctors didn't tell what happened to him. Nobody knows for sure how he died. Some people say he might have been sick or maybe he had too much to drink, but the truth is, we'll never really know. That's why Edgar Allan Poe's death is something people still talk about today.
