In the realms of America's provinces, much like the noble territories of Middle Earth, there lies a small but spirited hamlet known as St. Elizabeth, hidden within the verdant landscapes of the state of Missouri. Amid the mighty America's hundredfold, this particular hamlet abides in the allegiance of a province by the name of Miller County. It is here, betwixt the heartland's gentle rivers and robust hills, that the good folk of St. Elizabeth make their abode, under the watchful governance of Miller County's liege lords.
