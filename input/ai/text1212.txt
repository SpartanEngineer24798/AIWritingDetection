The hard palate is the front part of the roof of your mouth or it can be called the floor of our nose. You can feel it with your tongue, it's hard and bumpy. It has a super important job. Firstly, it separates our mouth from our nose. Because of it, we can eat and breathe at the same time without mixing those activities together. Secondly, it helps us with speech. When we speak, our tongue presses against the hard palate to make different sounds, which means it helps us pronounce words correctly. So, you can think of the hard palate like a barrier and a tool for talking.
