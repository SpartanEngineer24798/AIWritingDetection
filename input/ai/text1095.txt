The presence of Christianity in Sub-Saharan Africa dates back to the early first millennium. Around 42 AD, Mark the Evangelist is said to have established the Coptic Orthodox Church in Alexandria, Egypt, which can be considered part of Sub-Saharan Africa. However, the first definitive foothold of Christianity was around the 4th century AD when the Aksumite empire, now modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea, adopted it as the state religion. The spread of the religion varied greatly within the region over the centuries, greatly influenced by migration, trade, and European colonialismo. During the colonial period in the 15th - early 20th centuries, Christianity became more widespread, with Protestants, Anglicans, and Catholics spreading it throughout the region. Hence, the introduction of Christianity to Sub-Saharan Africa occurred in stages starting from around the 1st century AD, but the religion only became widespread much later.
