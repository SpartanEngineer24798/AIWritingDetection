Well now, the Iraq War, it sure was a tough time for many. It started in 2003, what my mama always called a 'conflict that split opinions'. From what I hear, it's said that 4,424 US servicemembers lost their lives during that time. It's real sad to think about all those brave souls who didn't make it back. I sure hope we remember them all for their courage and sacrifice.
