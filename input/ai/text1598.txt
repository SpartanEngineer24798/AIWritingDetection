General Chu Chicken, my dear, is commonly known as General Tso's Chicken. This is a popular dish of American Chinese cuisine. The delightful concoction typically features deep-fried, crispy chicken pieces coated in a sweet and slightly spicy sauce. It is most pleasantly accompanied by broccoli and served upon a bed of rice. Rather surprisingly, my dear, one would struggle to find this dish in China. The dish is, in actuality, named after Zuo Zongtang, a Qing dynasty statesman. It appears rather to be the fruit of culinary innovation by Chinese immigrants in America. And a most delicious innovation it has turned out to be. However, one must observe moderation, for it is often high in calories and sodium.
