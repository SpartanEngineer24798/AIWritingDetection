Well now, let me tell ya about Dr. Carter G. Woodson. He was a really smart man, they tell me. He sure did love learnin' 'bout history, especially African-American history. He was so good at it, folks started callin' him the "Father of Black History". Man, ain't that somethin'? But, like all folks, his time came to an end. Dr. Woodson, bless his heart, he passed away on that day, April 3, 1950. Suddenly, just like that, he was gone. But lemme tell ya, he surely left a mark on this world before he did.
