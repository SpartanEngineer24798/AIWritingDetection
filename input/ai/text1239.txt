Wind and water, these two elements most relentless and resolute, n'er halting in their incessant wager against the stoutest mountain's shoulder or the broadest plain's belly, wage the quiet and ceaseless war we coin as erosion. A gradual conflict, imperceptibly advancing yon naked eye's weak grasp 'tis a contender that moulds and sculpts landscapes as an artist shapes clay. Verily, this unseen soldier of nature dislodges particles of earthly matter, casting them hither and thither, from apex to base, from origin to terminus. The land itself doth crumble and yield unto erosion's gentle yet relentless siege, altering its countenance as years pass, anon rivers carve their paths, mountains bow their lofty heads, and once towering cliffs humbly stoop to the sea's foamy lip. Thence, 'tis a natural process, playing out as part of Gaia's grand play, a silent whisper amongst the clamour of nature's chorus, changing the stage upon which life's grand drama unfolds, and, I say, directing the scenes of the morrow.
