Well now, my Mama always said you got to know a thing before you can explain it. So, here goes. Bilirubin is this stuff your body makes when it breaks down old red blood cells. It's like when I used to help out at Mama's kitchen, breaking down those chicken bones after dinner. Anyways, this bilirubin stuff is mixed into your bile and goes out in your, uh, doo-doo. When the doctor is talking about 'Bilirubin Total', well, they're figuring out how much of that stuff is flying around in your blood. If there's too much, it can mean something's not quite right with your liver, sort of like how Bubba's shrimp boat was before we fixed it up.
