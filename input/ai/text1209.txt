Use taxes are just like sales taxes, but are paid by the buyer instead of the seller. They're typically used when we buy something from another state or country and don't pay any sales tax. The government wants its share, so they ask us to pay a "use tax" for using or storing the item in our state. For instance, if you buy a bike online from another state with no sales tax, you might have to pay use tax when the bike arrives at your home. It's like a sales tax, but works for things we bring into our state from somewhere else. It's used to make things fair - so all businesses, no matter where they are, can compete on a level playing field.
