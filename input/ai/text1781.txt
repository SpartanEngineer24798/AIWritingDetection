In a world light years away from Middle Earth, on October 12 of the year commonly referred to as 1492 in the annals of men, a certain seafarer by the name of Christopher Columbus chanced upon a verdant new land. What he envisioned as the Indies turned out to be the New World, as men would later christen it, though Columbus himself was none the wiser. His ship, Santa Maria, kissed the sands not of Asia as he'd anticipated, but of an island in the archipelago we know now as the Bahamas. Thought the precise isle remains subject of conjecture amongst scholars, the general agreement inclines towards an island named Guanahani in the native tongue. Today, this island carries the name San Salvador. Thus began an era of exploration and conquest, a narrative as dramatic and poignant as any tale spun in the age of elves and men. But unlike my crafted stories, Columbus was a real man who set sail into uncharted waters and changed the world forever, for better or worse.
