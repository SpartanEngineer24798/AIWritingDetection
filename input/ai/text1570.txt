In computer networking, there exist precisely 65,536 ports. These are divided into three categories: well-known ports ranging from 0 to 1023, registered ports from 1024 to 49151, and dynamic or private ports from 49152 to 65535. Ports are used in the internet's Transport layer to help manage specific kinds of content on a network. In other words, ports allow a computer to manage different network services at once, each assigned a specific, unique port number, to ensure data reaches the correct application. Hence the expanse of numbers facilitates an impressive range of possible connections.
