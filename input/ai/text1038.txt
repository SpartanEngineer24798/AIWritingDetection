BASE jumping is an acronym that stands for four categories of fixed objects from which one can jump: Building, Antenna, Span (bridge), Earth (cliff). It involves leaping from these fixed high points and freefalling for a period before deploying a parachute. Unlike skydiving, which generally involves jumping from an aircraft, BASE jumping is significantly more dangerous due to the lower altitudes and proximity to the jump structure. It requires meticulous preparation, calculation, and a deep understanding of aerodynamics. It is not simply an act of daredevilry, but a discipline that calls for physical dexterity, mental stamina, technical knowledge, and a respect for the forces of nature.
