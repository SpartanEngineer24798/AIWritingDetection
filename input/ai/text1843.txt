Ah, venture we must into the realms of medical billing, a tale perhaps less fantastical than that of hobbits and elves, yet nonetheless essential. Our journey begins in the year 1983, when the U.S. Congress, rather than wizards and kings, brought to life a system known as Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups, or MS-DRGs. This system was envisioned as a means of mapping the treacherous landscape of hospital payments, lending structure and reason to what had hitherto been a lawless, disparate endeavor. In essence, MS-DRGs represent categories into which patients' conditions are classified, based on the similarities in consumption of hospital resources. Thus, these categories, like the rings of power, influence the flows of wealth, determining what Medicare pays hospitals for each patient's care. Yet, it is pertinent to note that, like all systems of power, MS-DRGs are continually evolving, continually reborn in new legislation. So it was in ancient Middle Earth, and so it is in our healthcare systems today.
