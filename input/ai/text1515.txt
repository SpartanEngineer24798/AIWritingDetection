My dear friend, the answer you seek is quite elementary, considering of course, one possesses requisite knowledge on American beer brands. Rolling Rock, as you rightly mentioned, is in fact a popular brand of pale lager beer embossed with a painted horse logo on its characteristic green bottles. The company traces its roots and original brewing to the small town of Latrobe, Pennsylvania. However, the necessary bits have changed since then. The brewing process of this beloved beverage moved from its original location in Pennsylvania to the premises of Anheuser-Busch InBev in Newark, New Jersey, where, to this day, it continues. So, it stands to reason, and to answer your query directly, Rolling Rock is currently brewed in Newark, New Jersey, United States. Adieu!
