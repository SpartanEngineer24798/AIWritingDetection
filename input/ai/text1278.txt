A letterbox movie, dear friend, is not but a marvellous spectacle upon thy screen vast and wide. In an effort to ensure the replication of the original theatrical experience, this format doth permit the viewer to bear witness to the full breadth of the film's panorama, in line with the vision of its creator. It is named so, for the black bars, akin to the slits found on a letterbox, that appear both above and beneath the displayed image. By these means, expanding thus the aspect ratio, not a detail shall be clipped nor skewed, and the entirety of creations like the grand landscapes in a play, the marvel of intricate battle sequences, or the subtlest of directorial details, might be viewed as originally intended by the artisan. Thou art hence presented with the chance to view the film in a state most authentic, within the confines of thine own dwelling. Verily, a letterbox format is the closest one might come to a true theatre-like spectacle at home.
