Crikey, mate! You can do a ton of things with linen. Their breathability and lightness make them spot on for clothing such as dresses, shirts, trousers, or shorts. They'd give you that comfortable feel even when the outback is sweltering. 

Linen's also great for making bedding and curtains due to its durability and natural temperature regulation. In fact, it gets stronger the more you wash it, making it the perfect choice for items that need frequent cleaning. 

Lastly, you can use linen for tablecloths, placemats, napkins or even tea towels. This is because linen is highly absorbent, which can be very useful for soaking up spills promptly. 

Remember though, linen can be a bit tricky to care for, so make sure you follow proper cleaning guidelines to keep your items looking as fresh as a daisy. As a conservationist, I appreciate that linen is environmentally friendly too - being made from flax, a sustainable crop. It's a win-win for both us and nature.
