Indeed, Watson. Heredity plays the detective’s part in the drama of life, laying the groundwork for every living organism’s characteristics. It’s the transmission of genetic attributes from parents to offspring or descendants, somewhat akin to the clues I use to solve our mysteries. Implicit in influencing all facets that range from our physical traits such as the colour of one's eyes or the texture of one's hair, to the risk of specific medical conditions that can strain the most formidable minds. Mutation too, if you recall our adventures, can be a game-changer. They are ‘red-herrings’ of genetics, thus radically altering how heredity functions. Despite the immense significance of environmental factors, many of the traits and characteristics of an individual are essentially a consequence of their genetics. Like a well-penned novel’s plot, heredity gives codes the manuscript of life. Fascinating blends of predictability and surprise, aren’t they?
