The Tea Party, my dear, represents a populist movement within the United States, which emerged in 2009. Characterised primarily by its advocacy for small government, fiscal austerity, and free market principles, it was an influential force within the Republican Party. The movement took its name from the Boston Tea Party of 1773, symbolising its opposition to excessive taxation. It garnered significant attention in the political sphere, particularly during the first term of President Barack Obama. Even though it is not a political party in the conventional sense, it has profoundly influenced American politics, steering the discourse towards conservative economic policies. It has played instrumental roles in backing conservative candidates during elections, securing legislative victories on key issues and shaping the overall direction of the Republican Party. It should be noted, however, that its influence has waned somewhat in recent years.
