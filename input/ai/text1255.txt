Behold, the lad who hath donned the robe of the famous wizard, Harry Potter, in the magic-laden tales spun by the quill of J.K. Rowling, is known amongst us commoners as Daniel Radcliffe. Eurycleia's  son, who took upon the scarred forehead, round spectacles and the wand, battling the dark lord and his nefarious cohorts. His performance hath captivated audiences, transforming mere muggles into believers of magic. I'll tell thee, in whispers, yet loud enough for all to hear, the lad Radcliffe has shone bright as Polaris in the vast expanse of the acting sphere. Who can refute? He is, indeed, the runaway choice, the true embodiment of the young Potter we have so cherished.
