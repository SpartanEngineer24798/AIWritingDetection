Crikey mate! Santa's missus, she's a real top sheila. The world knows her as Mrs. Claus. But her first name? It's not really well known, some reckon it may be Jessica or Mary. But between you and me, she's just as important as Santa himself, always behind the scenes making sure everything rolls smoothly for the big bloke's annual ride. Good on ya, Mrs. Claus!
