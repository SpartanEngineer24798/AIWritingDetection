Well now, silk can be used for a whole lot of things. It's smooth as butter and pretty as a peach, just like my mama used to say. You got clothes made from silk, like dresses, ties, even underwear. Yes sir, silk's mighty comfortable. It's not just about wearing it, though. Because silk is so darn sturdy, people use it for things like parachutes and bicycle tires. I reckon some folks use it to make art too, like fancy wall hangings and banners that look right nice when the sun shines through. Mama also had a silk bedsheet, said it kept things cooler in the summer. So you see, silk is mighty useful, not just for wearing and looking pretty. But I think Mama loved it best because it always felt soft and gentle, just like a mother's touch.
