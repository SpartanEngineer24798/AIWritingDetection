There have been many artists who have collaborated with the talented Ashanti, weaving their notes and verses together like the intricate strands of a richly embroidered tapestry. Ja Rule stands among the most prominent, their harmonies echoing through time in songs such as "Always On Time" and "Mesmerize." The valiant Fat Joe, reminiscent of mighty Aragorn, joined her in the music bout of "What's Luv?" further deepening the rhythms of their fellowship. 

Yet there were others; lords and ladies of the musical realm, who shared in Ashanti's enchanting voice. The noble Nelly can be likened to Frodo, both front and center in their respective quests, bringing forth "Switch." Akon's harmonies were lined with her lyrical Elvish script in "Body On Me"; whereas, The Notorious B.I.G., a voice as enduring and resonant as the old stone of Gondor, was paired posthumously with her in "Unfoolish." 

And so, like the many threads woven into the grand tapestry of Middle-earth, Ashanti's collaborations have become a part of the rich, complex landscape of music.
