Certainly, my dear Watson. An irregular heartbeat referred to as Premature Ventricular Contractions, or PVC, is a common type of cardiac arrhythmia, where the heart experiences extra beats. It originates from the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart, hence the name. These beats, unlike the regular ones, tend to occur too soon, disrupting the normal heartbeat rhythm, which typically monitors a seamless transfer of blood from the heart to the rest of our body. Most of the time, PVCs are harmless and may not even cause noticeable symptoms. However, frequent PVCs or those associated with other heart health conditions might warrant serious attention and medical interventions. As our heart functions as a remarkable biological metronome, any glitch in its rhythm like PVC, might be concerning and should, therefore, be evaluated, no matter how seemingly inconsequential.
