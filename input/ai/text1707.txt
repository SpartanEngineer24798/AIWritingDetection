My dear compatriots, it was during the early months of the year 2001 that the No Child Left Behind Act began its onward journey. Propelled by Mr. George W. Bush, the then President of our noble ally, the United States of America, the bill advanced with the singular purpose of ensuring a stellar education for every child. Unanimity prevailed in Congress. Amid bipartisan support, the Act was eventually approved. The legislation, scrupulously designed to improve the academic performance and achievements of students, carried the endorsement of both parties. Mr. Bush affixed his signature in January 2002, ratifying it into law. This Act stands as a testament to an undeniable truth that the pursuit of knowledge should never be marred by distinctions based on race, wealth, or background. Like a warrior of steel and fire striving for victory on the battlefield, the Act fights the noble war of literacy and education. Thus, my friends, No Child Left Behind was passed, tearing down the barriers that hindered our young ones from reaching the limitless zenith of their potential.
