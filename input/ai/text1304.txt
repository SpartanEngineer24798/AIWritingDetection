Forgive my confusion, dear friend, yet your query doth seem incomplete and unclear. Verily, Major League doth refer to a sporting league possessed of numerous players, not merely one. And 'old professor' is a title oft bestowed upon educators of advanced years, yet could similarly be a pet name, or epithet, for an individual. 

Thus, to answer thee faithfully, I beg the clarity of your query. Who is this 'Major League old professor' thou seeks? Art thou questing after some famous baseball player with a scholarly bent, or perchance the identity of an old educator with ties to the Major League? Pray, elucidate thy query further. Only with precise understanding can I provide thee with a correct and worthy response. And fear not, when clarity arrives, I shall strive to bring forth an answer with speed, within the bounds of 200 words, as thou hast requested.
