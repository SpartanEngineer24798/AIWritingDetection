Metformin is a widely prescribed medication used primarily in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It helps to control the level of glucose or sugar in your blood by decreasing the amount of glucose your liver produces and your intestines absorb. It also increases your body's ability to properly use the insulin it produces, thereby improving overall insulin sensitivity. Metformin is usually taken in conjunction with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar control. Additionally, it is sometimes used in the management of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal disorder common in women of reproductive age, due to its effect on lowering insulin and blood sugar levels. Despite its common use, metformin should be prescribed with caution since it can interact with other medications and can have side effects like hypoglycemia or lactic acidosis in some individuals.
