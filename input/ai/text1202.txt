Uncle Sam is a symbol of the United States and he represents the American government. He is usually drawn like an old man wearing a tall hat with red and white stripes, a blue coat, and white pants. His hat sometimes has white stars on a blue band, just like the American flag has. People often see pictures of Uncle Sam when they are learning about American history or politics. When we see Uncle Sam, it is like he is saying, "Hey, this is America!" Uncle Sam is a reminder for us to be good citizens, to vote, and to be proud of our country. So, he is a very important symbol for all American people.
