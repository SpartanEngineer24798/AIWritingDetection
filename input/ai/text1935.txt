Well now, Apple Computer, that's a big company. It's like a giant apple tree that started real small from a tiny sapling. And that sapling was put in the ground by two fellows named Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, in their garage, believe it or not. The year was 1976, that's right, April 1st, 1976 to be exact. Isn't that something? All that from a garage. Mama always said, life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get. In this case, they got themselves a big ole tech company.
