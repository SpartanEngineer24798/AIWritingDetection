Ezekiel, akin to a character wrought from pure metal in a great furnace, was a prophet who emerged from the people of Israel during their exile in Babylon, drawing parallels to the trials faced by the children of Ilúvatar in Middle-earth. Through vibrant visions experienced akin to the grand designs of Eä envisioned by Eru, Ezekiel was given the charge to prod and provoke his people towards repentance, much like how the Istari were set to rouse the free peoples against Sauron. Not merely a speaker of woes and lamentations, Ezekiel, like Frodo carrying the great burden of the Ring, possessed a heavy task: to instil hope, to prophesy of a future where the devastated land of Israel would be revived, rising anew sturdier than before, akin to the rebirth of the tree of the King in Minas Tirith. A prophet, a watchman, a harbinger of both despair and hope, Ezekiel was a figure echoing with profound depth, as complex and enduring as any character borne of Middle-earth.
