Ah, Ischemia, it presents itself when there's insufficient blood flow to an organ or part of the body, the dear heart most commonly. It mechanises as a result of valiantly narrowing or blocking blood vessels, depriving the tissue of the necessary life-sustaining oxygen and nutrients— a most distressing event indeed, I must say. This often augments chest pain, identified as angina, and if left unresolved, could result in an infarction. Infarction, you may wonder? Well, this term is employed to describe the perishing of tissue due to this prolonged lack of blood flow, as might tragically occur in a myocardial infarction or ‘heart attack’. The affected tissue is unable to survive or regenerate, thus it is of the utmost importance, my dear, to seek prompt medical attention if such symptoms do arise.
