In the year of our Lord, nineteen hundred and ninety, in the city of Atlanta, the realm of the Southern United States, there arose an edifice dedicated to the sweet elixir of vitality known as Coca-Cola. It was built by craft-minded folk, artisans of trade and industry, a testament to the triumphs of manâ€™s progress.

Though this world of Coca-Cola, a haven for the histories and truths of the sweet brew, was constructed in 1990, in two score and seven years hence, it was reborn. The year 2007 marked the advent of a greater, grander monument to the same celebratory drink.

Thus, in this narrative of dates and decades, there emerges a tale of both creation and renewal, each equally integral to the tale of this museum - The World of Coca-Cola. Be that as it may, its spirit of innovation and tradition, akin to the substance it venerates, remains uncaged by the trappings of mere temporalities.
