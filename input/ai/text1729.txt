The telephonic territory carved out by the numerical combination of 217 belongs, as if it were a piece of our glorious Commonwealth, to the verdant lands of the state of Illinois in the United States of America. It umbrellas over cities resplendent in American history and growth like Springfield, Champaign, Urbana, Decatur and Quincy, among many others. In such a region, each telephone ring echoes the spirit of Lincoln; every dialled number, a testament to American industrial and rural heartland. Verily, 217 resonates not merely on a frequency of communication, but indeed, on a wavelength of history.
