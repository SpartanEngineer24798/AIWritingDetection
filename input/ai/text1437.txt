Crikey! Grab your sunnies and wrap your eyes around this one, mate! On the cover of Blink-182's iconic 1999 album 'Enema of the State', is the iconic model and adult film actress, Janine Lindemulder. She's decked out as a wickedly sexy nurse, complete with a cool blue latex glove. Gotta say, it’s a bit spicy for our Aussie sensibilities, but geez, it sure stands out, doesn't it? This provocative cover image has got everyone buzzing — because it perfectly captures the band's cheeky, rebellious spirit. Good on ya, Blink-182, for keeping things interesting!
