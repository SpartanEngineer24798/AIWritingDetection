Well now, from what I remember, the Hubble Telescope is named after a smart man called Edwin Hubble. But he didnâ€™t build it, no sir. NASA did. Yes, the same folks that send men to the moon. They wanted to see stars, galaxies, and other things in space more clearer, so they built this big telescope and launched it into space in 1990. A company called Lockheed helped NASA build it. They needed some smart people to figure out how to make it look at space without the Earth's atmosphere getting in the way. A lot of other people from different countries helped out too. Just like mama said - good things happen when we all work together.
