Naturally, my dear subject, cobalt has but one naturally occurring isotope and that is cobalt-59, with an atomic number of 27 and atomic weight of roughly 58.9332. As cobalt appears in nature, it is primarily, nay, entirely, cobalt-59. This particular isotope can absorb neutrons, transforming itself into cobalt-60, a radioactive substance used in medical treatments and industrial measurements. Cobalt-60, however, does not occur naturally and is merely the product of human manipulation. So you see, my dear, it is but cobalt-59 that graces the Earth with its natural presence.
