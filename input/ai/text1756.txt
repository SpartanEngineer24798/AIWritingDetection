The number of humps that adorns the stout back of a camel is indeed dependent on its species. The Dromedary camel, native to the harsh deserts of Middle East and the Horn of Africa, proudly carries a solitary hump, filled with sustaining fat that nourishes it amidst scarcity. On the other hand, the sturdy Bactrian camel, a hardy creature that traverses the rugged terrains of Central and East Asia, boasts of two bulging humps, fortifying itself against the harsh winter and scorching summer. To sum up, ranging from the arid desert to the frosty steppe, you shall find camels adorned with either one or two humps, a testament to their adaptability and resilience.
