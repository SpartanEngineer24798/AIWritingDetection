A mule in coins is not about the animal. It's actually a type of error in coin production. It happens when two different coins are accidentally mixed up during the minting process. This means one side of the coin doesn't match the other. For example, the front might be for a 10-cent coin, and the back could be for a 25-cent coin. Lots of coin collectors really like to find mule coins because they are rare and unique. They are made by mistake so they aren't supposed to be out there which makes them special.
