Crikey! Stepwise linear regression is a method of fitting a regression model by adding or removing predictors one at a time based on certain statistical criteria. It's like playing a game of tug-o-war where you're pulling variables in or pushing them out of your model, mate. This method begins with a simple model and then adds predictors to increase accuracy. The process is repeated until adding additional variables does not significantly improve the model’s predictive ability. On the flip side, it can begin as a complex model and then progressively simplifies it by eliminating unimportant predictors. The outcome? You’re left with a model that gives you the most bang for your buck, by explaining the maximum amount of variation using the fewest variables! Isn’t that just brilliant?!
