Well now, ain't that an interesting question. Soy, you see, is made from soybeans. Now, these ain't just any ole beans. No sir, they're special kinds. They grow on a plant that gets about waist-high and theyâ€™re tucked inside little bitty pods, just like peas. These soybeans, they come in all kinds of colors - green, yellow, even black. And once they're ripe, well, you can do a world of things with them. Crush 'em into oil, turn 'em into milk or tofu - that's a kind of cheese, even press 'em into sheets to make something called soy paper. It's fascinating, really. Just like how Mama always said, "Life was like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get," the same could be said about soy. You never know what it's gonna be next! So, to sum it all up, soy is made from soybeans. But what that soy becomes, well, that's a whole different story.
