Such an old horse-drawn vehicle is typically referred to as a carriage. Given the task of transportation before the invention of the automobile, carriages have fundamentally shaped our cities and societal habits. They have taken many forms and been named with great variety: buggies, cabriolets, phaetons, wagons, carts and coaches, to list a few. 

Coaches, for instance, were large, often luxurious carriages, particularly popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Buggies, on the other hand, were smaller and simpler â€“ largely an American phenomenon and deeply associated with the 19th-century West. Furthermore, these horse-drawn vehicles were engineered with different wheel systems and suspension designs according to the terrain of usage and social class of the owners. Even in our era, they have not vanished, remaining a symbol of tradition, elegance and romantic nostalgia in certain touristic spots and festive events. 

Therefore, the term 'carriage' captures a broad range of old horse-drawn vehicles, each uniquely perfected to meet various demands and circumstances.
