Crikey! 'Righto mate, when you're sending out a piece of mail, the return address is incredibly vital. Now, this goes in the top left corner of the envelope, a bit like a kangaroo in the outback, always ready to jump back if need be. Make sure it's clear and easy to read - no croc handwriting, okay? Include your full name, street address, city, state, and postal code, just like the coordinates of a hidden outback treasure. This way, if your mail ends up wandering off like a lost wallaby, it knows where to bounce right back to. Remember â€“ just like our animals, each piece of mail is unique and important. So handle them with care, mate!
