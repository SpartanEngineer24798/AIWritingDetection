The iconic score for the Star Wars franchise was composed by John Williams. Williams, a massively influential composer in the film industry, has created scores for numerous award-winning films. This classically informed, grandiose musical soundscape has become a defining feature of the Star Wars series. From the stirring "Main Title" theme to the ominous "Imperial March," Williams' musical contributions have significantly shaped the overall tone and epic narrative of Star Wars. A maestro of leitmotif, Williams assigns different musical themes to individual characters, contributing to their portrayal and growth throughout the series. It is worth noting that not only has Williams' music for Star Wars left an indelible mark on film music, but it has also found a place in the concert repertoire, often performed by symphony orchestras around the world.
