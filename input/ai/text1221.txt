Red eye in photos happens when the flash of a camera reflects off the blood vessels in a person's eyes. When we take a picture with a camera, sometimes, the flash is so quick that our eyes don't have time to shrink the pupils. So, a lot of light enters our eyes. Some of this light hits the back of our eyes where there are a lot of blood vessels. This light then bounces back towards the camera, and because blood is red, the photo shows our eyes as red. This is often more noticeable in darker conditions because our pupils are bigger to let in more light.
