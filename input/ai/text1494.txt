Land parcels, dear Watson, are individual units of land maintained by a governing body like a county or municipality. They are unique, clearly defined with specific boundaries, akin to a chessboard where each square belongs to someone different. It is the ownership of these parcels that's registered in public records, facilitating the property tax system and other legal matters. The size and shape of a land parcel can be quite variable reflecting the chaotic nature of human societies. These parcels may have buildings or other structures, or they could be vacant. At the end of the day, land parcels are just mankind's attempt to forge order in a world of inherent chaos, like a conductor before an unruly orchestra, wielding the baton of law and order.
