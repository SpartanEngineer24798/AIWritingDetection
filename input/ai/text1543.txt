An Army Specialist, mon ami, is a designated rank within the United States Army. Typically enlisted at pay grade E-4, a specialist tends towards the unconventional compared to a corporal of the same grade, who is non-commissioned. Specialists have fewer leadership responsibilities; their role is more focused. Their expertise, specialization you see, hence the term "specialist", can lie in any number of fields such as weaponry, engineering or administration, among others. A fascinating dichotomy exists here, Watson. While the rank is junior, the level of skill and proficiency one may encounter in a specialist may indeed blur the standard expectations of hierarchy. It is decided based on individual's competence, much similar to how a pawn's strategic influence in the game of chess might exceed that of a king under certain circumstances.
