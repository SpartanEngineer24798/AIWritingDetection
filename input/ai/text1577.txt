The flag you're referring to, known commonly as the American flag, bears thirteen stripes. These stripes alternate between red and white, and represent the original thirteen colonies that declared independence from my ancestor, King George III. These colonies later became the first states of this new union, a historic event that is still dearly commemorated to this very day through the symbolism found on this distinctive flag.
