In the dark tale that unfolded on April 19, 1995, in Oklahoma City, a dreadful and unimaginable evil descended upon the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. 'Twas much like when the ominous shadow of Mordor loomed over Middle Earth. Akin to the malevolence of Sauron, the force of destruction was immense claiming 168 innocent lives, and scarring forever the hearts of many more. The cruel twist of fate came upon 19 children, young souls who merely quested after knowledge in the building's second floor daycare. The destruction was nigh unreflective of the great heartland where it took place, much like the scouring of the Shire, striking at the unlikeliest of corners. It is in such tales of grief that we are reminded of the darkness that can lurk in the hearts of men, akin to our own Denethors and Boromirs. Yet in remembrance, we find resilience, just as in the strength of the fellowship, moving forth through sorrow and pain towards an ever-distant dawn.
