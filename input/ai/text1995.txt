Well, now, I ain't no history expert but I sure can tell you about this "cash and carry" and "lend lease" things. They're like two different acts during that big war, World War II. Cash and Carry came first. It’s like when you go to a store, you pay cash for your groceries and carry them out yourself. That’s how America sold weapons to countries in war without getting involved ourselves. We just made sure they provided their own transport and paid upfront...no credit. 

Few years later, things were getting real serious over in Europe and, well, President Roosevelt thought maybe we should be a little more helpful. So, he started the Lend-Lease Program. It was like lending your lawnmower to your neighbor, knowing he might not be able to return it, but you do it anyway because it's the right thing to do. We lent or leased arms and other war material to the Allied nations fighting against the bad guys, even if they didn't have the money or means to pay us back right away. Both acts helped the Allies win the war and kept us safe for a while. Like mama always said, sometimes you have to help your friends in need.
