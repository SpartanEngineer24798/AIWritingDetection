Passover is over after exactly one week. It starts on the 15th day of the Jewish month of Nissan and ends on the 22nd day. The exact date changes every year because the Jewish calendar is different from the calendar we use normally. It's definitely over after the Seder dinners and after we've spent the week remembering the story of Exodus and eating matzah instead of bread. So, when you see people eating bread again after a week in mid-spring, you know Passover is over!
