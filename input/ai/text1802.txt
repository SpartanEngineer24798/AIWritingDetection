Let me tell you a tale from the winter of 1947, on a day ensnared in the grip of a whirlwind romance. The twentieth day of November it was, when the trees had shed their colourful autumn attire and the earth was cloaked in anticipation of the approaching winter. It was on this day that two hearts melded into one and Queen Elizabeth II, then Princess Elizabeth, was wedded to Lieutenant Philip Mountbatten, now known as Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. The venue of this historic ceremony was the renowned Westminster Abbey in London, a monument that has stood witness to countless milestones of the British monarchy. Thus, it was, on that long-ago November day, amid the splendour of a British royal wedding, that a love, destined by the stars above, took flight into the realm of matrimony. This has since journeyed through the corridors of time, immortalised in the pages of history. Now, if you'll excuse me, I must return to other tales of yore; tales of hobbits, elves and distant, mysterious lands.
