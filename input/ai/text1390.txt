Crikey mate, we're talking about a bonza historical figure here, Paul Revere. This true blue American patriot was actually born in the heart of Boston, Massachusetts, US of A. His first cry a greeting to the world was on January 1, 1735-- or as they reckoned back then, December 21, 1734, history's a ripper, isn't it? So basically, this fella who ended up riding miles on horseback to warn his mates about the British, kicked off his journey in life in good ol' Boston, right in the thick of America! Awesome, ain't it? Blimey, history is a thrilling beast!
