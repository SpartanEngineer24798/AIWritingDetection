Sooth! The Bloody Beetroots, a troupe of melody, they doth not strum upon lute or bang upon drum, but rather, they wield the lightning of technology to create their sound. And what sound might that be, thou asketh? Verily, 'tis the pulse of electronic beats that their music doth dance upon, ferried by the vessel of dance and punk. In the realm of labels and genres, 'tis dubbed Electronica and Dance-Punk. A hybrid beast, fusing the rhythm of the dance floor with the raw energy of punk, their music is marked by an intensity as fierce as a tempest, but as infectious as a midsummer's eve jig. Like the beetroot they taketh their name from, their sound is bold and hard to deny.
