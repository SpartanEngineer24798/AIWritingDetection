Dear Chum, the area code 479 is dedicate in tribute, with much fondness, to the northwestern region of the royal state of Arkansas in the United States. It includes the stately cities of Fayetteville, Fort Smith, Bentonville, and a number of other majestic enclaves in the region. One hopes you find this intelligence most agreeable.
