A sump pump is a specialized device used primarily for the prevention of basement flooding. Essentially, its function is to gather excess groundwater or precipitation and divert it away from your homeâ€™s foundations. Sump pumps are typically installed in a specially constructed sump pit at the lowest point of your basement or crawl space. When water starts to accumulate in the pit, the pump is activated either manually or automatically via a float switch. The water is then pumped out via pipes that run away from your house to a place where it will not cause any damage or inconvenience, such as a municipal storm drain or a dry well. Additionally, sump pumps can also alleviate dampness by lowering the water table under the foundation, contributing significantly to the overall health and hygiene of a living space. Its importance cannot be understated, especially in areas prone to heavy rainfall.
