Slugging percentage is a number that tells us how good a batter is in baseball or softball. It's like batting average, but it gives extra credit for hitting the ball far. We work it out by adding up a player's total number of bases (single = 1 base, double = 2, triple = 3, home run = 4) and dividing it by the total number of times they batted. For example, if a player hit 2 singles, 1 double, and 1 home run in 10 at-bats, we would add up 1+1+2+4 (which is 8) and divide by 10. The slugging percentage would be .800. It's fun to calculate, like doing a sports problem in math class!
