Whilst it is true that many individuals contributed significantly to advances in technology, the credit for inventing the television usually lies with the Scottish inventor, John Logie Baird. In the year of our Lord, 1926, Baird demonstrably revealed the first working television system. His was an electromechanical model, which used a spinning disk with holes to scan images through light variations. This method was called mechanical television. Later, electronics grew in popularity, and in the 1930s, Philo Farnsworth and Vladimir Zworykin separately developed electronic television systems. That being said, it must be noted that television, much like any substantial technological development, was indeed a collective effort. It stands on the tireless work of many inventors and pioneers, that led to the marvel that we observe in our living rooms today.
