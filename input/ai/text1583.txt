The domain "eu" is the country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the European Union (EU). It was introduced on December 7, 2005 and official operations commenced on April 7, 2006. While it was initially intended for entities connected with the EU, restrictions were later loosened, allowing anyone in the EU to register a domain. Nevertheless, it remains a symbol of the unity and identity of the Union on the digital landscape. As of October 2021, the United Kingdom is still eligible to use the .eu domain, but after Brexit, it is possible that UK registrants may lose their eligibility.
