Corpus Christi, Latin for 'Body of Christ', is a Christian observance that honors the Holy Eucharist. It is celebrated on the Thursday after Trinity Sunday or, in some countries, the following Sunday. The holiday commemorates the Last Supper, during which Jesus Christ instituted the Holy Communion, according to the New Testament of the Bible. Originating in the mid-thirteenth century, this solemnity underscores the joy of the Eucharist being the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Many Christians, particularly in the Catholic tradition, receive Holy Communion on this day. Corpus Christi is also marked by processions in which the Blessed Sacrament, housed in an ornamental vessel known as a monstrance, is carried through the streets, accompanied by hymns and prayers. The feast showcases Christianity's focus on the sacraments as an outward sign of inward grace, demonstrated by the central role of Eucharist in church services.
