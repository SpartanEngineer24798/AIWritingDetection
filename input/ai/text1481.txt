My dear Watson, dear old Paul Revere, famous for his midnight ride, was, in fact, born in the bustling city of Boston, within the confines of the state of Massachusetts, in the United States of America. His introduction to the world took place on January 1st of the year 1735, or December 21st, 1734, depending on whether you observe Old Style or New Style dates. This distinguished city served not merely as his birthplace, but also as the primary stage for his numerous historical acts. Quite so, this prosperous silversmith turned renowned patriot was indeed a son of Boston through and through.
