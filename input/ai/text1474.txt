A surveyor's wheel, my dear Watson, is quite an ingenious device. To a common observer, it simply appears as a wheel attached to a long handle. However, upon closer inspection, one can understand its true value. As the wheel rotates along the ground, it measures the distance travelled. Now, you may ask, how does it achieve this? Indeed Watson, this is where brilliant mechanism comes into play. There's an internal mechanism, often a gear or a series of gears, that counts the number of rotations made by the wheel. Given the wheel's circumference, a simple calculation can convert these rotations into a corresponding distance. Thus, with each spin, the wheel records the distance traversed, providing an accurate measurement of distances too large for a measuring tape or a ruler. It is most frequently employed by surveyors, contractors, and other professionals needing precise measurements of large areas, like building sites, roads, or fields.
