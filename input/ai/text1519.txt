As Sherlock Holmes, I would deduce the cause of seasons not as a mere act of cosmic happenstance, but rather as the result of two factors: Earth's axial tilt and its orbital path around the sun. Our planet is tilted at an approximate angle of 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit. As Earth travels its elliptic course, this tilt causes the angle of solar radiation to vary widely, creating alternating patterns of climate and daylight hours. During a certain part of our orbit, the Northern Hemisphere is more inclined towards the sun, leading to longer daylight hours and higher average temperatures – namely, summer. Conversely, when the hemisphere is inclined away, shorter days and lower temperatures result – marking winter. The Southern Hemisphere, adhering to the same principles, experiences these changes at opposite times. Spring and autumn, or the transitional periods, occur when both hemispheres are exposed to the sun at nearly equal extents. Hence, I would conclude that the mechanism behind our Earth's changing seasons involves a complex yet elegant interplay of tilt and trajectory.
