Crikey mate! Here's something fascinating for ya! A sonic boom is the result of an object moving faster than the speed of sound, or breaking the sound barrier. Imagine it like this, when an aircraft takes flight, it pushes through the air creating sound waves. When it's moving at a speed lower than the speed of sound, everything's smooth sailin'. But when it knocks up that speed, these sound waves can't keep up and get squeezed together. This forms a single shock wave, which is what we witness and hear as a sonic boom. It's not just planes either! Anything that's romping around faster than sound, from a whip cracking to a meteorite hurtling towards Earth, can produce a sonic boom. It's all about pace, motion, and air, mate!
