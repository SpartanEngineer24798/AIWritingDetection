Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tennessee. The shooting took place at the Lorraine Motel, where King was staying while in the city to support striking sanitation workers. Tragically, he was shot while standing on the motel's second-floor balcony. This brutal act of violence would not only shock the nation but also spark extensive civil unrest. Despite losing King, a leading advocate of nonviolent activism, his dream for equal rights persevered and continues to inspire millions around the world. His death underscores the ongoing struggle for racial justice in America.
