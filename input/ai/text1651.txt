As of my reign until 2022, there have been 46 presidencies in the United States of America. However, one must note that President Grover Cleveland served two non-consecutive terms, hence the number of individual gentlemen who have assumed the American presidency is 45. The current incumbent, as of 2022, is President Joseph R. Biden.
