Well, now, the FOIA, or the Freedom of Information Act as it's rightly called, applies to federal agencies in the U.S., it sure does, just like a bee applies to making honey. It's this law that says the public has the right to ask for access to records from any part of them federal agencies. But it ain't all sunshine and rainbows, 'cause there's exceptions. Some stuff like classified national defense and foreign relations information, personal privacy data, and a few other things ain't included. Look up FOIA exemptions for the full list, or else you might end up chasing after a bus that's done already left the station. But otherwise, anyone can file a FOIA request and get to look at documents that the government has, just like a person can eat a whole box of chocolates if they really want to.
