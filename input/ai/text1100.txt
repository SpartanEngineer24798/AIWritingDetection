Four Thirds Cameras, also known as Micro Four Thirds Cameras, are a type of mirrorless camera that uses a specific image sensor size and lens mount. The Four Thirds system was pioneered by Olympus and Panasonic in the early 2000s. The "four thirds" refers to the camera's sensor size, which has a 4:3 aspect ratio. This is larger than that of most compact cameras, but smaller than the typical digital SLR (DSLR) camera, making it a middle-ground choice for many photographers. The main advantage of these cameras is their smaller size and weight compared to a DSLR, due to the absence of the mirror and optical viewfinder. However, they still offer interchangeable lenses for greater flexibility and typically have better image quality and more advanced features than compact cameras.
