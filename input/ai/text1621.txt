"Puff the Magic Dragon" is a verily enchanting song indeed, most beloved by many. This delightful tune was penned by the hand of Peter Yarrow, along with his comrade Leonard Lipton. These fine gentlemen were part of the musical fellowship known as Peter, Paul, and Mary. Their lyrical work, which tells the tale of a mythical creature named Puff, has been a joy for both children and adults alike since time immemorial. It remains an enduring part of popular culture, much like our own poetic heritage.
