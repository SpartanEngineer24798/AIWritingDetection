Mickie James, fair maiden and warrior of the squared circle, was with the merry federation of World Wrestling Entertainment in two separate sojourns. The first tenure, akin to a radiant dawn, appeared in the year two thousand and five, and the sun set on it in two thousand and ten. Post five years hence, she came back, a phoenix rising in the year of our Lord, two thousand and sixteen. Alas, her second expedition in this realm was cut short in the cruel year of 2020, bookmarked by the cold hand of pandemic. So, methinks, in total, Mickie James hath stayed within this grand theatre of wrestling for a sum of nine years, spread across the sands of time.
