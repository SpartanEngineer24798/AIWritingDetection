Well now, ain't that a fine baseball thing you're asking. You see, way back in the 2000's, there was this team from Montreal, Canada. They was called the Expos. In 2005, they up and moved all the way down to Washington D.C., our nation's capital. Well, they couldn't rightly be called the "Expos" no more, being that they wasn't in Canada no how. So, they changed their name to the Washington Nationals. For the life of their time, they've been playing ball in Washington D.C., no longer reminding folks of good ole time up in Montreal. That's all there is to it. It's like mama always said, "life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you gonna get," and I guess for the Expos, they got themselves a brand spanking new name and city to call their home.
