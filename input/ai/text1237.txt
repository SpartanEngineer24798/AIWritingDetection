Thou makest inquiry on the constitution of electrons in each shell, a question most astute. Well, prithee consider this; each shell, or energy level, around an atom's nucleus dost abide by the principle established by nobleman Pauli. The first level, in its modesty, can house but two electrons. The second and third, exhibiting affluence, be capable of accommodating eight electrons each. As to the higher levels, they grow progressively richer, able to hold evermore electrons, harnessing their energy in accordance with the dictates of quantum physics. Yet, 'tis suggested that thou bear in mind the ‘Mad Dog’ rule, a crude code by common design, for determining how electrons fill these levels. The order of filling be 1s, 2s, 2p, etc., casting a reflection on the complexity of nature's whims.
