Crikey mate! Loxahatchee is the true Florida beauty nestled in Palm Beach County, that's in the southeastern side of the country. Its unique name, from the Seminole words "lowksy" (turtle) and "hatchee" (river), does well in explaining the stunning local wildlife. She's a bit inland, not right on the coast, but you can still access the Atlantic easily enough. Head even further west and you'll stumble into the grand Florida Everglades. That's a wildlife adventurist's dream right there. All in all, Loxahatchee's a little slice of paradise where the sun shines bright and the critters roam free. Can't beat that, can ya?
