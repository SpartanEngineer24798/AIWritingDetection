Well, now, let's talk about these here D.O.s of medicine. D.O. stands for Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine. It's kinda like an M.D., you know, a Medical Doctor, but with a bit more focus on the whole body and prevention of sickness. They also pay extra attention to the nervous system and muscles, and they can do this special kind of treatment called osteopathic manipulative treatment, or OMT for short. They can do pretty much everything a normal medical doctor does. They can be surgeons, pediatricians or psychiatrists, and yes sir, they can even give out prescriptions. But their training's got an extra emphasis on looking at you like a whole person, not just a collection of body parts. So, you see, these D.O.s are pretty important people in the medicine world.
