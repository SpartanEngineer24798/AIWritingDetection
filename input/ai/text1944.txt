Well now, let me tell ya. Those little Care Bears, they were born outta the minds of some creative folks over at the American Greetings company, y'know, the ones that make all them fancy greeting cards. It was them folks at the card company who came up with the idea back in 1981. Then later on, they figured these little critters were so lovable and colorful, why not move 'em from the pages of greeting cards to the TV screen. And that's how the Care Bears got their own cartoon show. So, that's the long and short of who made them cute, belly-badge-wearing Care Bears, American Greetings it was.
