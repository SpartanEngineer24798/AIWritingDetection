Well, now, an irregular heartbeat is when your heart doesn't beat the way it's supposed to. It's like a drummer that gets off beat, but it's your heart, which is a lot more important. PVC, that's short for Premature Ventricular Contractions. That's a big mouthful, so we call it PVC. It's like your heart gets anxious to beat and does it too soon. It's usually harmless, like when you trip while running, and then you keep going. But sometimes, it might be a sign of something serious. So if your ticker starts acting up, you better go see a doctor. Just like how I went to see the doctor with Lieutenant Dan when he was feeling poorly. Just take it easy, and let the doctors figure out the rest. I think that's about it.
