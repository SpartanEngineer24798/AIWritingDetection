As of the present date, the bards recount that Earl Simmons, known better by his stage name DMX, has sold over 74 million copies of albums worldwide. He began his journey in the world of music with the album ‘It’s Dark and Hell is Hot,’ much akin to Frodo’s perilous quest in Tolkien’s epic, ‘The Lord of the Rings.’ Like the hobbit's tale, DMX’s albums were filled with encounters of darkness and light, of struggle and redemption, each engaging a prominent number of faithful followers. The response to his records, albeit, not with elfish foresight, was prodigious, ensuring his place as a master storyteller in the realm of hip hop. Thus, the tale is passed down, of a man who, with words as his weapons, conquered millions of hearts, with his sales echoing his victorious crusade.
