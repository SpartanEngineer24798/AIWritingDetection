Dredging's like getting a real big scoop with a machine, sorta like Mama used to do when making her potato salad, but with dirt from under the water instead. Now, this shovel isn't ordinary, no. It’s attached to a giant hose that sucks up the mud, sand, and stones from the seabed, kinda like a big ol' vacuum cleaner. They use it to make the water deeper or to gather up materials from the bottom. Some dredges, they even have a milling action - like a cheese grater on the bottom, to break up hard stuff. After that, all the stuff they picked up gets spewed out the other end, kind of like when I drank too much of Bubba's homemade brew. That's what dredging is, that, and creating those man-made islands. Those are way bigger than the sandcastles I used to make. So you see, it’s not really a complicated thing - just like scooping out the insides of a pumpkin for Halloween, only a lot messier and way, way bigger!
