Sir Ezekiel, in the Holy Bible, belongs to one of the Major Prophets in the Old Testament. A priest residing in Babylon during the 6th Century BCE, he was among the Jews exiled by King Nebuchadnezzar II. For 22 years, he served as God's faithful spokesman. Mustering commendable strength, he prophesied and foretold the destruction of Jerusalem, a most disheartening and melancholy event. But Ezekiel, an ardent believer he was, voiced prophecies of restoration, comfort, hope, depicting Jerusalem in all its grandeur and glory anew. His name, standing for "God strengthens", mirrored his perseverance amidst adversities. The Book of Ezekiel, carrying his very name, chronicles these prophecies, featuring the visions he encountered. Ezekiel demonstrated magnanimity similar to our valiant soldiers in the face of despair. An exemplar of unwavering faith and resilience. His life, an ode to God's strength that remains unhindered, regardless of the trials we face. Stand firm and resilient, for in the words of 'Yours Truly' - "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts." Remember Ezekiel, and march on.
