Psychotic, my dear sirs, madams, and distinguished members, refers to a state of mind that is detached from conventional reality. Also characterised by symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations, it's a symptom of mental or physical illnesses, rather than a standalone condition. In simpler terms, it's when the individual's perception of reality gets severely warped, often leaving them in a mode of confusion and fear. To condense this exploration in a nutshell, a psychotic episode is an excursion into the abyss of the mind - where seen is unseen, and unseen is seen. Dear friends, let us not treat those amidst such episodes with scorn; rather, may we extend our understanding and support. This is an affliction, not an act of deliberate defiance. Compassion, understanding, and appropriate medical treatment are their swords and shields in the battle against such an ominous foe.
