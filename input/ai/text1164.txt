A file-based system is like a big cupboard where you keep all your things in different boxes. Each box is a file that stores similar types of things. For example, one box could have all your toys while another box could have all your clothes. To find something, you first need to know which box it's in. Similarly, in a computer, a file-based system keeps different kinds of data in separate files. If a computer program wants to get some data, it needs to open the right file first. So, a file-based system helps to organize your data just like how you organize your toys and clothes in different boxes.
