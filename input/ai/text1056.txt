Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (OAEs) are sounds generated within the inner ear when stimulated by a sound. They are considered a by-product of the active processes that enhance the neural coding of sound in a healthy cochlea. There are two types: transient evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). TEOAEs are evoked by a brief stimulus like clicks, while DPOAEs are evoked by two simultaneous pure-tone stimuli.

These emissions are measurable through a tiny probe placed in the ear canal. Testing OAEs is a valuable tool for newborn hearing screenings and in assessing the function of the cochlea in patients of all ages, especially those who can't readily respond to traditional behavioural hearing tests. In the presence of cochlear damage, such as in sensorineural hearing loss, the amplitude of the OAEs is reduced or absent, indicating a deficient auditory system. Hence, evoked otoacoustic emissions provide valuable diagnostic information about the auditory system's health and functional status.
