Alpha Lipoic Acid and Lipoic Acid are two names for the same compound. Much like a hobbit is also known as a halfling, or an elf referred to by the woodland fair folk, these two names merely denote the same mystic compound found within the realm of man. Alpha Lipoic Acid, a powerful antioxidant and co-factor in various key reactions within the wondrous machinery of our bodies, is merely its official title. Lipoic acid, on the other hand, is its common name, like Bilbo to a fellow hobbit. Both are used interchangeably, embodying the same qualities, banishing the shadow of oxidative stress and maintaining the equilibrium of the body's energy metabolism, while warding off the ill effects wrought by age or disease, to ensure the well-being of the body as if guarded by the secret power of an Elven ring. Thus there is, as such, no difference between these two, save in the letters that spell their titles.
