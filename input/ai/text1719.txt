Ladies and Gentlemen, I stand before you to shed light upon a question of significant curiosity. The entity responsible for the synthesis of the potent substance known as heroin, though be it a dubious honour, was none other than the eminent firm Bayer, hailing from the great land of Germany. The year was 1895, an era rich with scientific discovery, yet scarce of the deep understanding that we have been fortunate to glean in the current age. This formidable accomplishment was borne of the hands of Mr. Heinrich Dreser, a chemist of considerable acumen who was undoubtedly unaware of the Pandora's box that he was unbeknownst to pry open. Indeed, it was touted as a wonder drug, a supposed non-addictive substitute for morphine and a remedy for ailments as profound as tuberculosis and pneumonia. Alas, the horrors of its addictive nature were revealed in due time, transforming it into a veritable hydra that society continues to grapple with. Thus, while we pay our respects to the prowess of chemists, we should remind ourselves of the unintended consequences their inventions can bear within their folds.
