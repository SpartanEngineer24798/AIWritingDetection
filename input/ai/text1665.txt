An insulin syringe, dear, consists of three parts: a needle, a barrel, and a plunger. The barrel holds the insulin dose, clearly marked in units for precise dosage. The needle, attached to the barrel, allows insulin to be injected under the skin. The plunger, a slender rod fitting snugly inside the barrel, is used to draw insulin into the barrel and deliver it into the body. The insulin, generally delivered subcutaneously, soaks into blood capillaries and commences the needed duty of regulating blood sugar. Remember, it is not to be punctured into a vein or muscle, but just under the skin. And, it is essential to discard the syringe after a single use. This medical device, simple as it may seem, changes the lives of individuals burdened with diabetes. It is a patient's best aide in striking that all-important harmony of blood sugar levels, keeping the untoward effects of diabetes at bay. Keep Calm and Inject On, I say!
