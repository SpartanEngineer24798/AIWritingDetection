Wellness is about being healthy in both your body and your mind. It's like when you're eating good foods, exercising and getting enough sleep so your body feels strong and energetic. But it's also about feeling happy, being kind to others, and learning new things so your mind feels good too. Wellness isn't just about not being sick, it's about feeling your best all the time. It's about balance - when what you think, what you do, and who you are all work together to make you feel good. It's like having all the pieces of your life puzzle fit together in the best way.
