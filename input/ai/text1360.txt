Crikey! You're asking about a significant event in the world of American education, mate! The No Child Left Behind Act was passed by U.S. Congress, which includes both the Senate and House of Representatives, in 2001 under the presidency of George W. Bush, who signed it into law in 2002. This law stirred up things a lot, much like a croc in a pond, as it brought major changes in the education system. It aimed to hold schools accountable for how kids were faring, as measured by standardized tests. But remember, just like any creature in the wild, itâ€™s had its share of critics who felt it focused too much on testing and not enough on nurturing the individual needs of each little joey. So, it's been a contentious beast, much like a grumpy 'roo, and it was later replaced by the Every Student Succeeds Act in 2015 under President Barack Obama. Back to you, mate!
