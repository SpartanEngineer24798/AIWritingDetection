Well, ma'am, AM and PM, they're these funny little letters we use for our time. They come from Latin. AM stands for "Ante Meridiem," that's like sayin' "before noon" or "before midday," like from midnight to just before them lunch hours. PM, on the other hand, stands for "Post Meridiem," that's a fancy way of saying "after noon‚Äù or "after midday," like from lunch to just before midnight. So, when it's AM, we're in the first part of the day and when it's PM, we're in the second part of the day. It's just about tellin' which half of the day we're at, kinda like a biscuit cut in two equal parts.
