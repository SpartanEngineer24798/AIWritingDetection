Crikey! Hurricane Katrina, a real humdinger, she started as a tiny little tropical depression over the Bahamas on August 23, 2005, mate. Gathering strength and power, she moved northwest towards the United States, picking up intensity over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. By the time she reached the tip of Florida, she was a pretty formidable force of nature. Leaving destruction in her wake, she swung around for another pass. On August 29, she barreled into Louisiana and Mississippi as a Category 3 storm, setting off a cascade of events, resulting in one of the most catastrophic natural disasters in U.S. history, that's for sure!
