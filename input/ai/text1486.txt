Ah, elementary my dear questioner. A simple inquiry so easily solved through the vast expanse of our collective knowledge. We simply cast our minds back to the year 2011. A banner year for baseball, filled with all the unpredictable thrill that often accompanies the sport. The location selected to host the Major League Baseball's All-Star Game that year was none other than the radiant Chase Field, located in the bustling city of Phoenix, Arizona. This sun-soaked spectacle was indeed an extraordinary one, featuring baseball's finest players under the Arizona sun, in the place they affectionately call 'The Valley of the Sun'. There you have it, my dear interlocutor, your answerâ€” the grand game of 2011 was battled out in none other than Phoenix's own crown jewel, Chase Field.
