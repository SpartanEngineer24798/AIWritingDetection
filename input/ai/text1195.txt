Fantasy American football is like a game where you pretend to be the boss of a football team. You pick real football players to make up your imaginary team. Each week, you compete against another person's pretend team. You get points based on how your players do in real life during their games. If your quarterback throws a lot of touchdowns, or your running back runs a long way, you get lots of points. The team with the most points wins. It's like playing a video game or playing pretend, but you get to use real football players. It makes watching football games even more fun because you care about how certain players do. It's also a fun way to show your friends that you know a lot about football.
