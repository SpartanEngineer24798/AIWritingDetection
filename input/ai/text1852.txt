Burgundy is a color invoking a rich sense of depth and complexity. It sings of somber reflections of the red wine grapes from a land echoic of medieval grandeur named for it, Burgundy in France. It is reminiscent of the silent hidden essence of the earth, the deep and velvety twilight of the hedgehog's slumber, the soft touch of a ruby-rich harvest-fallen leaf, and the dreams where dying embers lay. Sue to this, the color Burgundy also embraces the allure of a sadly beautiful, vanishing sunset. An arm of ripe cherries, a brush of raven wings, or the embroidered robes of an Elven king; such wealth of imagery, this Burgundy casts. A complex blend of scarlet red paired with the inky depths of brown, and balanced with a dusky shadow; weave together to devise this noble hue. Not as loud and vivacious as the red, Burgundy whispers elegance and class, a quiet dignity; like a seasoned tale-teller slowly unveiling an age-old secret.
