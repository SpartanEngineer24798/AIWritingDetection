The name of the mountains along California is the Sierra Nevada. They are very long and high, stretching over 400 miles from north to south! Many people like to go there to hike, ski, and explore nature. The highest peak in the Sierra Nevada is called Mount Whitney and it's the tallest mountain in the entire United States (except in Alaska). Another famous place in the Sierra Nevada is Yosemite National Park, which has beautiful waterfalls and giant sequoia trees. Another important mountain range in California is the Coastal Ranges which are right by the Pacific Ocean. Altogether, the mountains make California a very beautiful state!
