Crikey, mate! Talking about dough, it's just as hard to pin down as a slippery saltwater croc! The total private wealth in the United States fluctuates, but, as of the end of 2020, we're looking at a whopping $122 trillion! Yes, mate, that's trillion with a 't', like a ten-foot tall tiger! It's definitely the land of plenty! That's assets less debts, including residentsâ€™ equity in real estate, plus financial investments and small business interests. But remember, mate, just like an animal's habitat, this wealth isn't equally distributed. A few folks like those tech billionaires hold a fair chunk of it. Blimey, that's a whole lot of kangaroo pouches! But it's not all easy street: plenty of folks are just scraping by. Takes all sorts to make a world, doesn't it? Just like in the animal kingdom.
