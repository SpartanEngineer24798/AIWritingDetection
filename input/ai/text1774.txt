The number of electrons that can occupy each shell around an atom is determined by a simple rule elegantly summed up as 'two times shell number squared'. Each shell, increasing in distance from the nucleus, accepts additional electrons in proportional increments. The innermost shell, also known as the first shell or K-shell, accommodates just 2 electrons. Progressing outward, the second shell accommodates 8. Further still, the third shell is a trickster, it can hold 8 or 18, depending on the atomic number! Thus, conscripts into these concentric circles of atomic regiment marching around the nucleus are done so following this rule. Each shell securing its ranks before the next begins. Much like the formation of a robust defensive line, they ensure atomic stability.
