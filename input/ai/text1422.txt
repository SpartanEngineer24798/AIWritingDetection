Crikey! The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, it's a beaut, mate! It’s used to discover the relationship between differentiation and integration, two central operations in calculus. It basically comes in two parts. The first part says, if you have a function, and you go through all the hassle to find its definite integral and make a new function out of it, the derivative of this new function would be the same as the original function. Wild, right? The second part, this one's a real ripper! It tells us how to compute the definite integral of a function using anti-differentiation! So it's an absolute timesaver! Without this little gem, we wouldn’t have the tools we need for analysing physics, engineering, statistics, economics and loads of other fields.
