Indeed, it was President Thomas Jefferson who made the decision to purchase Louisiana from France. This historical event, known as the Louisiana Purchase, took place in the year of our Lord 1803. It was a monumental decision that doubled the size of the United States and gave it control of the Mississippi River and the port city of New Orleans. The purchase was made for a sum of $15 million, which seems a pittance for such an expanse of land. This move demonstrated his foresight and strategic thinking for the growth of the young nation of the United States. It was a grand acquisition indeed.
