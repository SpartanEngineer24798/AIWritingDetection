Well, now, you're asking me about folks who speak Spanish here in the US. I ain't no fancy census taker, mind ya. But I heard somewhere that there's more than 41 million folks who natively speak Spanish. Add to that some 11 million more who're bilingual, that's them who speak both English and Spanish. So, if you put them numbers together, guess you got over 52 million folks. That's like a good deal of people, ain't it?
