Verily, sirrah, the melodious tune dubbed "Mama Told Me Not To Come" was by the band of musicians known as Three Dog Night. This group of merrymakers, hailing from the far reaches of Los Angeles, did belt out this verse in the year of our Lord, Nineteen Hundred and Seventy. Their rendition of the song, penned by the bard Randy Newman, did scale the highest peaks of popularity, becoming a much-admired ballad throughout the realm.
