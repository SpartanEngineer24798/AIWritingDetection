Mn, that's Minnesota there. Home of ten thousand lakes, well... actually even more than that if you count 'em all, according to what I heard. It's up north, real cold in winter and a place where folks love fishing and hockey quite a bit. Ain't that something? I do believe it's got them big cities too like Minneapolis and St. Paul. Even got a famous mall, the Mall of America, biggest one I ever heard of. Now, ain't that place something?
