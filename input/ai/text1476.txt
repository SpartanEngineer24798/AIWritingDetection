"Freedom Summer," Watson, was an ambitious civil rights project that took place in the summer of 1964, predominantly in the southern state of Mississippi. It was designed with the aim to increase black voter registration, which was outrageously low due to systemic discrimination. Corroborated by various civil rights organisations, including the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the mission was to establish "Freedom Schools," which were alternate educational institutions to counteract the poor performance and lack of resources faced by the segregated Mississippi's schools.

Over 1,000 volunteers, most of whom were white, northern, college-aged students, partook in this project. However, they were met by violent resistance from white supremacist groups and local authorities. This summer saw the notorious murders of three civil rights workers, Michael Schwerner, Andrew Goodman, and James Chaney, which gained national attention.

While it may be deemed successful or unsuccessful depending on the viewpoint, it undeniably brought about national attention to the dire situation in the Deep South, steamrolling the journey towards the monumental Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
