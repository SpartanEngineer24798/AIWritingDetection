Crikey! In German, the word "Meister" means "Master." So, if you're called a "Meister," that's a real ripper and means that you're really skilled or experienced in something. It is commonly used in trade professions to denote someone who has achieved a high level of expertise or mastery. Good on ya, mate, for learning a new language! It's as exciting as wrestling crocs!
