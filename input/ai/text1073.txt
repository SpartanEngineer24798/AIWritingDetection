"Cocaine," a famous rock song, was originally written and recorded by the noted American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and multi-instrumentalist J.J. Cale. Cale first released the song on his 1976 studio album "Troubadour." Popularized by the internationally renowned British rock musician Eric Clapton, "Cocaine" is one of several collaborations between Cale and Clapton. Despite the widely perceived endorsement of drug use, Clapton has frequently explained that the song is an anti-drug composition. However, the musical brilliance and the iconic guitar riffs often overshadow the song's message, paving the way for varied interpretations. Indeed, the dynamic intricacies of music and lyricism allow for this diversity in perception.
