Primary medicine, sometimes referred to as general or family medicine, represents the first point of contact an individual has with health care services. It is fundamentally all-encompassing; it is the discipline of health care that provides ongoing and comprehensive health services to individuals irrespective of their age, sex, or the nature of illness. It places emphasis on the pieces of the puzzle that form holistic healthcare: prevention, cure, and overall well-being, not neglecting the importance of disease diagnosis and treatment. Itâ€™s the duty of the primary care providers to understand the patient in their entirety; their home, workplace, and their community. Much like a trusty Bulldog during the Blitz, it stands steadfast, providing immediate care, day or night. Primary medicine bridges the gap between the public and specialized care services. It is, indeed, the very backbone of a robust healthcare system.
