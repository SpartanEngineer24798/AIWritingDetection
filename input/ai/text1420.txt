Crikey! Use tax is a bit of a crocodile in the pond for folks who make purchases from out-of-state or online vendors without paying local sales tax. It's like a sibling to the sales tax and, typically applies to items that are bought outside of the person's home state for use, storage, or consumption in their home state. Sales tax and use tax, however, usually cannot bite at the same time. If you pay sales tax on an item, you're generally off the hook for the use tax. But if you didn't, perhaps because your sly little purchase was made online or from some other remote vendor, then it might come back to snap you later! So, best always keep an eye out, mates! Remember, not all crocs are in the swamps, some are also in the tax code!
