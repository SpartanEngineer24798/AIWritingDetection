I am not an expert in human anatomy as per se, but my deductions lead me to an answer nonetheless. Observing meticulously, you would note that mucous membranes, very similar to those that line your nose and mouth, play a crucial role in acting as a barrier and fighting off unwanted intruders, much like an efficient doorman at an exclusive gentleman's club. The secretive nature of these gatekeepers of your body lies in the viscous substance they produce, aptly named mucus. This substance is, indeed, a thick and slimy fluid - slightly sticky to serve its purpose of trapping bacteria, dust, and other potentially harmful substances that dare to infiltrate your physical being. Mucus also contains antibodies and enzymes which contribute to the defense against these intruders. A rather indubitable function and an interesting surveillance system within the human body, I dare say.
