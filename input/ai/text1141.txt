The Biltmore Estate in North Carolina is owned by the Vanderbilt family. It was built by George Washington Vanderbilt II during the late 1800s. It's a really cool place and is actually the biggest private house in the whole United States. Even though George Vanderbilt is no longer around, his descendants or family members still own the estate today. The Vanderbilts are famous because they made a lot of money in the shipping and railroad businesses a long time ago.
