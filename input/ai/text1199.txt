Stingrays live in the ocean! That's called a marine ecosystem. They really like warm and shallow water close to the coast, and some even go into brackish water, which is water that is both salty and fresh. Their favourite places to hide are under the sand or rocks on the ocean floor where they can also find their food. Some types of stingrays can even live in fresh water, which we call a freshwater ecosystem. So, they can live in rivers and lakes too. Just remember, not all stingrays live in the same type of water because there are over 200 types of stingrays.
