Crikey mate! Amoxicillin is a bloomin' great antibiotic that we use to fight bacteria! Doctors might prescribe it for all sorts of infections caused by bacteria, like ear infections, bladder infections, pneumonia, gonorrhea, and E. coli or salmonella infection. It's part of the penicillin group of antibiotics and it works by stopping the bacteria from growing. But listen here, it's not effective against viral infections like the common cold or flu. Always take it as your doctor directs and make sure you finish the whole course, even if you feel better, to make sure all the nasties are gone. It's a pocket-sized safari for your immune system!
