Shri, my dear compatriots, is a salient word from the exquisite Sanskrit language, which, much like our own English tongue, carries a profound richness of legacy and culture. Acting as an honorific epithet, the term is often quite reverentially employed to denote respect, majesty, and splendour. It perhaps resonates the most with our Western term of 'Mr.' or 'Mrs.'. Yet, its cultural connotations proceeds beyond the mere trappings of any salutation, extending to symbolise fortune, prosperity, and even the divine feminine aspect in Hindu sacred doctrine. It is a term of both temporal and spiritual weight and as such, it invites us to appreciate the immense depth of cultural heritage and intricate linguistic profundities of the Indian subcontinent. So, let it be known by all that in the same spirit we laud gallantry with 'sir', the Sanskrit culture venerates their identities with 'Shri'.
