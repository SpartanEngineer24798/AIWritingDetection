The guy in the wheelchair who is really smart was Professor Stephen Hawking. He was a super famous scientist, like a real-life superhero of science! His brain was super powerful! He studied big things like stars and galaxies, and small things like atoms and particles. You know, that difficult stuff we call physics! Even though he was very sick and couldnâ€™t move his body, he never stopped thinking and learning. He also wrote a book called 'A Brief History of Time' which lots of adults find hard to understand. But he made it fun and interesting for everyone to learn about the universe! So, Stephen Hawking was not just a guy in a wheelchair. He was a brilliant man who taught us a lot about the world we live in.
