Well now, ain't that a fine question! Wilton, it's a pretty little place, located smack bam in the middle of California. And if my memory serves me right, which usually it does, Wilton is in Sacramento County. So if you ever find yourself in Sacramento County, make sure you drop by Wilton. It's a nice little spot. Mama always said, "get your counties right". It sort of sticks with you, you know!
