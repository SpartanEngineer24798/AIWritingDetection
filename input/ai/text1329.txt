The social norm approach, dear friends, is a noble strategy used in the realm of mental health to illuminate and transform perceptions. It dost revolve around the idea that people's actions are influenced by their perception of what is considered normal or common. Often, an individual's view of normal behaviour is skewed and may lead to negative actions based on misperceptions. By revealing how these perceptions are inaccurate, and hence shining light on healthier, truly more common practices, we can promote wiser and more beneficial conduct. The success of this technique lies upon the principle that individuals generally wish to align their behaviour with societal expectations. So, by accurately presenting what is normal, we may steer an individual's actions towards the higher path. Verily, the social norm approach is a guiding star, leading society to healthier shores.
