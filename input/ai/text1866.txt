A surname, often referred to as a last name or family name, is the name passed down through generations. It is typically shared by people within the same family and denotes familiar ancestry and lineage. Examples include Tolkien, Smith, Johnson, etc.

On the other hand, a given name is a personal name that is assigned to an individual at birth or during a naming ceremony. It is used to distinguish that particular individual within the family, as it is unique to them. Familiarly, it is often called a "first name". Examples include John, Ronald, James, etc.

Thus, in the case of J.R.R. Tolkien, 'Tolkien' is his surname, and the initials 'J.R.R.' stand for his given names John Ronald Reuel.
