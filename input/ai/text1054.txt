The Miami Marlins, a Major League Baseball team based in Miami, Florida, was established in the year 1993. Initially, the team was known as the Florida Marlins for the first 19 years of their existence. It wasn't until a change in ownership and the completion of a new ballpark in 2012, that the team underwent rebranding and changed their name to the Miami Marlins. The franchise has had notable success in its relatively short history, winning World Series Championships in 1997 and 2003. Despite this success, the Marlins have struggled with maintaining consistent performance, often having cycles of competitive seasons followed by periods of rebuilding.
