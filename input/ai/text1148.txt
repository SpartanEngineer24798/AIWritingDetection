A map is a picture that shows where things are. It can show lots of different things like cities, rivers, roads or even where different animals live. Maps help people find their way from one place to another. They also let us see how far away things are from each other. Just like a drawing, everything on a map is smaller than in real life. The map uses symbols, colors and labels to represent real things. It also has a compass to show North, South, East and West directions and a scale to indicate distances. So, if you want to travel or just learn more about the world, a map can be your best friend!
