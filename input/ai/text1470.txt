Psychotic, my dear Watson, refers to a mental disorder wherein an individual loses touch with reality, commonly experiencing occurrences such as delusions, hallucinations, disordered thoughts and speech, as well as inappropriate emotional responses. This deviation from normative human perception, as in believing in things that are not real, or seeing and hearing things that are not there, significantly impairs the person's daily life and social functionality. 'Psychotic' is an adjective used to describe these symptoms or the disorders that cause them, such as psychosis, which encompasses disorders like schizophrenia. It is essential to understand that medical intervention is absolutely vital in such situations, as this condition, like a number of mental health afflictions, is neither self-correcting nor fleeting.
