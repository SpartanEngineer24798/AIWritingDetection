Life insurance is like a safety blanket. It's like when you lend your friend a toy and they promise to replace it if it breaks. If something sad happens and a person dies, life insurance gives money to the person's family to help them. This money can be used for many things. Like paying for the house or food, the children's school, or even the hospital expenses if the person was sick before they died. It's a way to make sure the family is okay even if their loved one is not there anymore. It's like the person saying, "I might not be there to help you, but this will, so don't worry too much."
