My dear friend, imagine if you will, an industrial estate, dotted with formidable steel structures. In the heart of this setting, sits our focal point - a liquid oxygen plant. It stands tall, a colossal presence, characterised by a series of interconnected cylindrical towers and thick, serpentine pipes. 

The primary structures are the air compressors and cooling systems, fierce in their operation yet elegant in their engineering. These marvels of modern technology purify ambient air, separating oxygen from other gases by rapid cooling and consequent liquefaction. 

Tanks and storage units, large enough to evoke awe, speckle the premises, housing liquid oxygen waiting to be transported. Other peripheral structures like control rooms and maintenance facilities ensure smooth workflow. 

The plant, however much of an industrial behemoth it may seem, is governed by precise principles. Extreme attention is paid to safety standards, undoubtedly a priority given the highly reactive nature of pure oxygen. 

My dear friend, a liquid oxygen plant is a delicate balance between nature's laws and man's ambition, its physical form a testament to our ability to harness the elements.
