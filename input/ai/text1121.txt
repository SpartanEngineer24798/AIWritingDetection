Cabin pressure on US airlines, and most airlines across the world, is controlled to create a similar environment as if you were on land. Even if the plane is around 35,000 feet in the sky, which is super high, the cabin pressure inside feels like we are only 7,000 to 8,000 feet high. This is about as high as a tall mountain, and it helps our body feel comfortable. If they didn't control the cabin pressure, we might feel sick or struggle to breathe. So next time you're on a plane, remember, it's like being on top of a mountain with seat belts and snacks!
