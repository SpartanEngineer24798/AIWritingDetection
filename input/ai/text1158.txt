Saddle Creek was founded in the year 1966. This means it's been around for a long time, even longer than most of our parents! It's a company that helps other businesses with their stuff, like storing it and moving it around. They have lots of big warehouses and trucks to do their work. So, next time when you see a big truck with 'Saddle Creek' written on it, you can tell your friends that you know when this company was started and what it does. Cool, right?
