Facial or paranasal sinuses, the wondrous hidden caverns in our visage, are situated within the hollows of our skull bones. The foremost two, the maxillary sinuses, sit nestled in the cheekbones, like secret chambers under the eyes. Residing alongside the nose, akin to twin towers standing sentinel, we find the ethmoid sinuses. Above the ethmoid sinuses, in the brows much akin to lofty mountain peaks, rest the frontal sinuses. Lastly, swooping back like deep, unreachable valleys, the sphenoid sinuses hide near the center of the head. Beneath our visage, they attend to the quite remarkable task of secreting mucus to maintain the nasal cavity, whilst providing resonance to our voice and reducing the weight of the skull. These caverns, akin to the hushed, shimmering halls within mountains, are a fascinating part of the great fortress that is the human body.
