Non-binding means something is not officially required or forced. It's like a promise that you can choose whether to keep or not. In a non-binding agreement, it means people are not legally forced to follow it. So if someone doesn't do what they said, there's no punishment. It's similar to when you and your friend agree to trade lunch items at school, but then one of you changes your mind. While it might be a little disappointing, no one is getting in trouble because it was a non-binding agreement.
