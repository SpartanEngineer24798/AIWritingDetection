"Rock of Ages" is a jovial and rollicking piece of theatre, centered around the vibrant and unbridled energy of rock and roll, harking particularly from the 1980s. The narrative follows the dreams and travails of a young man from the Midwest, called Drew, who moves to Los Angeles to become a rock star. In this escapade, he meets, and just as quickly, loses, a young woman named Sherrie. The play vividly captures the zeitgeist of the era, its music, its optimism, and its sense of rebellion. The story is interspersed with some popular rock numbers from renowned bands of that time, creating a nostalgic atmosphere. All the while, we witness the larger-than-life character Stacee Jaxx, a rock legend that adds another layer of glitz and chaos. The tale, though seemingly frivolous, effectively portrays the passion, desire, and the cost of chasing dreams. It is a delightful celebration of the spirit of rock and roll, served with humour and heart.
