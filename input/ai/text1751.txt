"In the heart of the Pacific, amidst the splendifourous tropical paradise of Hawaii, lies the serene island of Oahu. She takes pride in boasting about her highest point, the topmost on her skyline, known as Mount Ka'ala. This awe-inspiring peak, draped in lush green, stands valiantly reaching 4,025 feet into the heavens above. Though modest in comparison to mighty peaks of the world, do not underestimate her grandeur. For it is not only the height that counts, but also the exploration and the victorious sense of achievement upon reaching the zenith. As I have often said, 'Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.' Braving the trail to Mount Ka'ala's summit, experiencing the captivating biodiversity and rejoicing in the panoramic vistas from atop, all offer a taste of such sweet success. So, when on Oahu, be sure to pay homage to her regal Mount Ka'ala."
