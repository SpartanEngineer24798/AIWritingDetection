Verily, alas for George O'Malley, young physician of fair heart and truer courage, meet the cruel hand of Fate. As a dauntless servant in the field of life and death, O'Malley answered the call of danger, stepping into the path of yonder rolling beast of iron and steel. Little could he foresee that his mantle, given in noble service, would serve as garb of doom. The carriages of the city roared, taken in horror; the lad, so earnest in his actions, under their gnashing wheels was thrown. His face, once full of familiar charm was now marred beyond all knowing. Dispatched to the surgical theatre, his comrades knew him not! His life, an existence bright, dwindled to a mere flicker before the flame was snuffed out completely! So passed George O’Malley, the light of life extinguished, leaving the Grey's Anatomy realm shrouded in grief-filled darkness. From hence, he lingereth no more in Seattle Grace, but in the chambers of their hearts. Here lies O'Malley’s tale: a hero's departure, draped in tragic garb. All too soon hath he faded into the realm of heartbreaking memories!
