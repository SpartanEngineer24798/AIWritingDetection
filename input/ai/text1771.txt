To "add my two cents" audaciously extrapolates one's covert desire to contribute their personal opinion or viewpoint to an ongoing discourse, particularly when it is uncalled for or unsolicited. This idiomatic expression springs from the notion of putting in a meagre amount, much akin to two cents, into a conversation and hence importuning, however politely, to weigh in on the scenario. Therefore, such a phrase is commonly used to preface one's ideas in a manner that avows humility and respect for other ideas, while simultaneously promoting thoughtful interrogation and free exchange of ideas. I hope, ladies and gentlemen, this explanation satisfactorily elucidates the spirit of this phrase.
