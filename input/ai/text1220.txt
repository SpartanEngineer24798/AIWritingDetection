Well, a credit union is like a bank, but it's owned by its members, not by shareholders. People who bank at a credit union are its members and they also own it. Isn't that cool? Navy Federal Credit Union was made for people who are in the navy, or their families, but now they let other people in the army and some civilians to be members too.
