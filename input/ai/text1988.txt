Well, I'm no financial expert, but Mama always told me, money can make more money if you know how to use it right. So, stocks and bonds, they're sort of like that.

Think of a stock like owning a small piece of a big company. When you buy a stock, you're buying a little part of that company. If the company does well, then your little chunk gets more valuable and you make money. But if the company does bad, well then your piece ain't worth as much.

Now bonds, they're a little different. Instead of owning a piece of a company, you're lending money to them or maybe Uncle Sam. Just like in real life, when you let someone borrow money, they gotta pay you back with a little extra, that's interest. That's how you make money on bonds.

So, both stocks and bonds are ways people try and grow their money. But as Mama used to say, never put your eggs all in one basket. It's always smart to spread things out a bit. That's about it.
