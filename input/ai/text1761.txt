As observed duly and with resolute understanding, the greatest concentration of Jewish population can be summarized in two major territories. Primarily, the state of Israel bears the mettle, being the singular homeland established for the Jewish populace globally. This provides a haven gravitating close to six and a half million Jews. Furthermore, the United States of America holds the second largest Jewish population, predominantly within the city walls of New York. Aside from these, there are considerable Jewish communities in varied cities around the world, including London and Paris. As such, the Jewish diaspora spans across the globe, preserving a rich cultural and religious heritage; yet, the vibrancy remains chiefly concentrated within the land of Israel and the wide expanses of America.
