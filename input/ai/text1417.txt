Crikey! Good Friday is an incredibly important day mate! It's observed during what we call Holy Week as part of the Paschal Triduum on the Friday preceding Easter Sunday. Now, it commemorates the crucifixion of Jesus Christ and his death at Calvary according to the New Testament in the Bible. Now, hold on to your hats because this isn't just any ordinary Bible story. This event is important because it represents the sacrifices and suffering in Jesus’s life, ultimately leading to his resurrection and liberating humankind from sin. It’s called ‘Good’ Friday because the term ‘good’ refers to the good gift of salvation brought forth by the martyrdom. Many Christian communities around the world remember this day with fasting and church services. In short, Good Friday is the cornerstone of Christian faith. So let's remember to reflect on our actions and strive to do better, just as Jesus would've wanted!
