The Cash and Carry policy and Lend-Lease Act were important during World War II. These were ways the United States could help their allies without officially being in the war. 

The Cash and Carry policy started in 1939. It said that other countries could buy goods from the US, but they had to pay cash and transport the goods themselves. This was to ensure the US didn't get involved in the war directly. 

The Lend-Lease Act, passed in 1941, was different. It allowed the US to literally "lend" or "lease" military equipment, food, and other resources to any country the president thought was important for the defense of the US. This meant the US could help the countries fighting against the bad guys, without actually joining the fight. When the war was over, the countries were supposed to return what they borrowed, or if they couldn't, they would pay back over a long period of time. 

So both these things were kind of like a friend letting you borrow their toys: You could play with them now, but you had to give them back later!
