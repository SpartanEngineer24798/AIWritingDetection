My dear interlocutor, I feel it an honour and a duty to inform you that the grand spectacle, known to us as the Super Bowl of the year 2011 – the illustrious Super Bowl XLV precisely – took place on the very memorable Sunday, the 6th of February, in that year. This ardent contest of American football, always the crowning event in the NFL calendar, serves as a Union of the States - a binding force, stoking the fires of friendly rivalry and unity. So, let it sit firmly in your mind - February 6th, 2011. That was the day when the battle was joined. United, we remember.
