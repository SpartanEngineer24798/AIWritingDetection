A synthetic conduit is like a special pipe that doctors use in our body when a natural one is not working well or is blocked. It is made from man-made materials, which is why it is called 'synthetic'. This synthetic pipe can do the job that our body's own pipe was supposed to do. For example, if a blood vessel, which is like a pipe for our blood, is blocked, doctors may use a synthetic conduit. This helps the blood flow smoothly again. So, a synthetic conduit is a very important tool that helps doctors keep our body working well.
