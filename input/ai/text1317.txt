West Side Story, a tale of two lovers caught amidst the chaos of warring factions, sprung from the pens of great visionaries. 'Twas conceived by Arthur Laurents, who wrote yon book. The master melody maker, Leonard Bernstein, gave birth to the music, a symphony of mirth and despair intermingled. Upon this score, the words of Stephen Sondheim danced, a ballet of eloquent speech. And from Jerome Robbins did spring forth the choreography, movements as poetry, the essence of conflict and love unfolded in dance. Four bards, in collaboration, spun this saga, akin to mine own tale of star-cross'd lovers, transposed to a modern setting, a teeming city of steel and glass. Choose love o'er conflict, they whisper through their creation, as do I through mine own works. Thus was West Side Story born, a progeny of four fathers, bearing the timeless message of love's triumph and tragedy.
