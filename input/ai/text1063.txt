Jermaine Lamarr Cole, professionally known as J.Cole, was born on January 28, 1985 in Frankfurt, Germany. However, his early childhood and formative years were spent in Fayetteville, North Carolina, U.S. His mother, a postal worker, moved there with him when he was just a child. Hence, while he was born in Germany due to his father's military service, J.Cole can be described as being primarily from Fayetteville. It was here, in this American city, that he had life experiences that would go on to greatly shape his music and lyrical content, making Fayetteville an integral part of his identity as an artist.
