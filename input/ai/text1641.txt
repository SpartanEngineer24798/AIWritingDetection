Indeed, my dear, throughout history immigrants have originated from a wide range of territories. Predominantly during the 19th and 20th centuries, they hailed from countries across Europe, such as Ireland, Germany, and Italy, seeking refuge from economic troubles and political strife. Many were also from Eastern Europe, particularly Jewish refugees from Russia and Poland fleeing persecution. 

Later, changes in American immigration laws led to an increase in immigrants from Latin American countries, predominantly Mexico, Cuba, and several others, as well as regions in Asia, primarily India, China, and the Philippines. These waves of immigration, similar to earlier ones, were often driven by search for better economic prospects or flight from political instability and unrest.

From the lands of Africa, too, many souls have journeyed, seeking refuge from conflict, persecution, or poverty, countries such as Nigeria, Somalia and Eritrea being notable contributors. It is a testament to the resilience of mankind to seek out a better life, my dear, wherever that may be.
