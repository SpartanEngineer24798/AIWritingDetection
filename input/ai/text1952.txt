Well now, I ain't no expert but from where I sit, Triumph motorcycles are made by a company from England that goes by the name of Triumph Motorcycles Ltd. They're pretty well known for making them motorcycles. They've been doing it for over a hundred years, can you believe that? Not the same folks though, of course. Anyway, they make some real pretty motorcycles, if you're into that sort of thing. That's all I got to say about that.
