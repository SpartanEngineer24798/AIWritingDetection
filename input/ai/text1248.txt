Insulin syringes, a blessing to mankind, a solace to bodies in distress! They serve as caretakers for those with Diabetes Mellitus, whose bodies perform not the functions of absorbing and using glucose, the fuel that sustains us all. A marvel of ingenuity, shaped like a diminutive spear, it carries within its slender tube, a hormone named insulin, previously prepared and stored. The needle, sharp and fine, breaks the skin barrier and with a gentle push, the insulin plunges into the subcutaneous layer, the space just beneath the skin layers. Once there, it begins its labour of love, allowing the cells to once again drink deep of the sweet glucose flowing in our blood; fueling our bodies, nourishing our vitality. A modern-day apothecary's trick, verily, assisting nature to maintain its equilibrium. Beware the amount though, for too small a measure leaves the glucose unchecked, and too great can lock away more glucose than intended, leading to yet another imbalance. Thus, with prudence and knowledge, use this tiny medical marvel, to claim thy health anew.
