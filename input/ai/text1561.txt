A TI-82, my dear chap, is a rather sophisticated device, designed and published by a company known as Texas Instruments. Introduced to the world around 1993, it is commonly referred to as a 'graphing calculator'. It allows one to plot graphs, solve equations, perform various complex mathematical operations amongst other useful functions, all housed in a portable handheld device. Primarily, its usage was popularised amongst students, aiding their educational pursuits, particularly in the realm of mathematics and sciences. It is the predecessor of the TI-83 model, and was the first in line to be given a glorious ‘Flash’ memory, enabling it to upgrade system software if the need arose. Its functionality has indeed been praised and it has served as a trusty companion for those dabbling in the world of numbers.
