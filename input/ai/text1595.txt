The cinematic creation of the beloved trilogy, "The Lord of the Rings", directed by Peter Jackson, began in the year of our Lord, 2001, with "The Fellowship of the Ring". Following it was "The Two Towers" in 2002, and the final film, "The Return of the King", premiered in 2003. A most enthralling fantasy saga, indeed.
