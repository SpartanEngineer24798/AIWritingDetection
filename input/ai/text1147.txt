D.O. stands for "Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine". They are fully licensed physicians who can perform surgery and prescribe medication like an M.D., which stands for "Doctor of Medicine". The main difference is that D.O.s are trained to have a more holistic approach to medicine. This means they look at the whole person to reach a diagnosis, rather than just focusing on the symptoms of a disease. They are trained to consider how lifestyle and community can impact your health. Also, D.O.s receive extra training in the musculoskeletal system which is your body's interconnected system of nerves, muscles, and bones. So, just remember, D.O.s are doctors too, and they can do everything an M.D. can do, but they may look at your health a little differently.
