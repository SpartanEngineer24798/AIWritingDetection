Urinanalysis, or UA as 'tis commonly known, doth serve as a crafty sentinel, vigilant in its search for divers maladies encroaching upon man's health. Looketh thou here upon such works as UA doth reveal: the presence of sugars awhence diabetes may be inferred, proteins indicating likely troubles of the kidney or urinary tract. A cadre of cells, blood, pus, or bacteria in urine can bespeak of infections gnawing from within. The vices of imbibing too much alcohol, or partaking of forbidden substances, too cannot elude the scrutiny of this assay. Stone-born ailments of the kidney might leave their trace detected as crystals. Thus goeth on the list of distempers UA may divulge; a silent watcher in the war 'gainst human frailty. Verily, this knowledge bringeth power in diagnosing, treatment and even prevention of disease, and standeth as a testament to man's ongoing duel with mortality.
