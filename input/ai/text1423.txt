Crikey! "Nature Boy," mate, is a beautiful song that was penned by an intriguing chap named Eden Ahbez. Ahbez was of a rare breed who lived under the Hollywood Sign in the late 1940s. The bloke was a mystical figure, a songwriter, poet, with a deep admiration for Mother Nature. His song "Nature Boy" was given to Nat King Cole by Ahbez himself, spending an entire summer sleeping under Cole's Hollywood stars. The tune became a hit in 1948. Ahbez's wilderness lifestyle was reflected in his lyrics about simplicity and love for the environment. A true tribute to nature, that's for sure, mate!
