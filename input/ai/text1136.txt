Joint committees are special groups that are formed with members from both the House of Representatives and the Senate in the United States Congress. They come together to focus on specific areas or issues, like the economy or taxation. There are four types of these: the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Joint Committee on the Library, the Joint Committee on Printing, and the Joint Economic Committee. They usually don't create laws but provide important information and make sure things are working properly. For example, the Joint Committee on Printing can make sure that all the documents needed for the government are printed! Imagine how much paper that would be!
