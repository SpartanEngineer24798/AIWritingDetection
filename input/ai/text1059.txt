During World War II, North Africa saw significant invasions primarily by two major forces - Axis powers (Italy and Germany) and Allied forces (primarily Great Britain and the United States). Italy initiated the invasions in 1940, targeting British-held Egypt and Sudan from their base in Libya. By later 1940 and early 1941, British forces had successfully countered the Italian invasion and advanced into Italian-controlled Libya. However, this scenario changed when German forces under Field Marshal Erwin Rommel were dispatched to Africa and took Libya for the Axis in 1941, threatening Egypt once more. To counter this, an Anglo-American invasion known as Operation Torch was launched in 1942 into Vichy French-controlled Morocco and Algeria. By 1943, the Axis powers were expelled from North Africa following the Tunisian Campaign. This Mediterranean theatre of operations served as decisive strategic events leading to the successful invasion of Italy and ultimately contributing to the end of WWII.
