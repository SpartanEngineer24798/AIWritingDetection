A discipline of study, or what we sometimes call a "subject," is a specific area of knowledge that people want to learn more about. Just like how in school we study different subjects like Maths, English, Science, History or Geography. Each of these subjects is a discipline of study because they have their own rules, methods, topics, and ways of learning. It's like joining a sports team. If you play basketball, you learn and follow the rules and skills for basketball, not soccer. That's the same with study disciplines, if you study Science, you're learning about experiments, facts about life and the universe, not poems or stories which you learn in English. So when you choose a discipline of study, you choose a special area or field that you want to be an expert in.
