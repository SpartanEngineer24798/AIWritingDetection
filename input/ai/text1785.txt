Previously, the GE Building in Rockefeller Plaza bore the name 'RCA Building', a name synonymous with the Radio Corporation of America. The building's dedication in May 1933 saw it transformed into a beacon of commercial broadcasting and telecommunication. RCA was heralded as a pioneer in the early development of radio and television, making the building an emblem of their innovative prowess. However, in 1986, RCA was absorbed by General Electric (GE), resulting in a renaming to 'GE Building'. Thus, this skyscraper amidst the thrum of Manhattan, standing as a silent sentinel to progress and change, has born witness to the shifting tides of industry, from the age of radio and television to the era of diversified conglomerates.
