Mount Rushmore is really cool and big! It's like four giant heads made of rock! They are actually the faces of four famous presidents of America: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. The place is surrounded by trees, and there's a walking path where you can see the mountain from different angles. You can learn lots of fun history about these presidents in the visitor center. It's not just for looking though, there are lots of activities too. You can become a Junior Ranger or watch a film about why and how it was built. The atmosphere is amazing, especially when the sun sets and they light up the mountain. It's an unforgettable experience! I mean, not every day you can see four presidents' heads in a mountain, right?
