Well now, ain't nobody can rightly say when the world's gonna end, listenin' like Jenny said, "Forrest, you can't predict no future." Might be a day, could be tomorrow, might never be. All I knows is we have to live each day like it's our last, make it count. I ain't no scientist, but I figure the Good Lord has his plan. You just gotta trust in that and run life's race best you can. That's what my Mama always said, "Forrest, God has his reasons that we don't always understand, but we just have to Trust." So, I don't reckon anyone can tell you what time the world will end on May 21, let alone any other days.
