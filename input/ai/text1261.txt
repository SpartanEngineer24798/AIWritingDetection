Assuredly, in the annals of history, 'twas a day of great outcry and lament; a tragedy unmatched on the stage of life. On the day when the moon lent its light to the sun, the seventeenth of February in the one thousand nine hundred and sixty fifth year of Our Lord, fortune’s wheel did turn unkind with its icy fickle gaze upon Malcolm X, a man of fiery speech and sharper wit. This courtier of controversy, this prince in the kingdom of civil rights, 'twas laid low in New York’s Audubon Ballroom; assassinated by villains most treacherous. His tale, like a midsummer night’s dream, ended in a tempest, leaving behind a vacuum oh so profound; the world never being as it once was. Thus was the mortal coil of the noble Malcolm X shuffled off, leaving us only his echo, his spirit, his inspiration. Adieu to a man more sinned against than sinning. Though silenced in body, his words, like the ghost of Denmark, still resonate within the echoing halls of time.
