The Universal Law of Gravitation says that every object in the universe pulls every other object towards itself. This pull or force is called gravity. The bigger the object, the stronger its gravity. Thatâ€™s why we stick to the Earth, because it's really big so it has a lot of gravity. This law also says that the further apart objects are, the less they pull on each other. That's why we don't feel the moon's gravity pulling us away from the earth, because the moon is very far away. So, no matter how big or small, everything pulls on everything else. This law helps us understand how planets move around the sun and why we don't just float off into space!
