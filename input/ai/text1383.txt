Crikey mate! Testosterone, that's the primary male sex hormone, is actually produced predominantly in the testes. These two blokes right here in the scrotum are responsible for producing most of the testosterone in the male body. However, they're not the only ones in on the action. A small part is also produced in the adrenal glands that are situated just above your kidneys. When it comes to ladies, testosterone is produced in smaller quantities by the ovaries and the adrenal glands. This hormone is a big player in maintaining some crucial functions in our bodies like muscle strength, bone density, and of course, it has a huge part to play in sex drive. So mate, that's where testosterone comes from!
