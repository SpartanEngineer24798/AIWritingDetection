A rocket engine works kind of like when you blow up a balloon and let it go. It flies around the room because the air inside rushes out, pushing it in the opposite direction. This is all due to a clever man named Newton's third law, which says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. In a rocket, fuel is burned to create hot gases. When these gases rush out of the bottom of the rocket, they push it upwards. It's kind of like the air rushing out of our balloon, but way, way stronger! So basically, by burning fuel and pushing hot gases out underneath it, a rocket can zoom up into the sky.
