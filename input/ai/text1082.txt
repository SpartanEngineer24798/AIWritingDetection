Cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. The exact signs of cancer can vary widely depending on its type and location, however, some general symptoms may include unexplained weight loss, fatigue, pain that does not go away, changes in the skin, including hyperpigmentation, yellowing, or reddening, and changes in bowel or bladder habits. Other symptoms might be sores that don't heal, unusual bleeding or discharge, difficulty swallowing, or persistent cough or voice change. It's important to note, however, that these signs could also be indicative of other medical conditions, so one should not hastily jump to conclusions. Always take any persistent symptoms seriously and consult with your healthcare provider to ensure an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. The earlier a diagnosis is made, the better the outcome can be. This is why regular screenings and self-examinations are recommended for early detection.
