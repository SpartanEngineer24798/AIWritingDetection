Well, now, deliverables are like a box of chocolates; you always know what you're gonna get. It's simple really. It's like when you're fishing and you reel in a big ol' catfish - that's a deliverable. It's a product, a report, or an outcome that you are supposed to "deliver" or hand over at the end of a project. Whether it's a freshly baked cake for a party or a big ol' report for some business folk, those sort of things are all deliverables. They're sort of like the finished puzzle, once all the pieces have been put together. And remember, just like how Momma always said "life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get", with deliverables you need to ensure you know precisely what you're giving, so folks get what they expect.
