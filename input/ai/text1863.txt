D.O. stands for Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine, harkening from a distinct branch of the healing arts in the realm of medicine, practiced in the United States. Trained similarly to their M.D. (Doctor of Medicine) counterparts, they complete a rigorous curriculum in medical school, yet with an additional holistic perspective. They emphasize a whole-person approach to treatment, tackling not only the maladies that assail the body, but promoting preventative health care, seeking to derail the onset of illnesses before they claim their dominion. Remarkably, a D.O. is taught to wield his hands, as if imbued with an innate healing power, utilizing Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment to diagnose and treat afflictions. However, much like an M.D., a D.O. may choose a specialty or subspecialty, drafting their own tale of expertise in a chosen field, be it surgery, obstetrics, or even infectious diseases. To claim this mantle, they must endure the crucible of residency and pass exams as set by their respective certifying boards. Hence, D.O., a title of distinct honor, is bestowed upon Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine.
