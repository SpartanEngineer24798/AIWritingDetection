Though he's more accustomed to describing the fair lands of Middle-Earth, Tolkien would note that in the year of Our Lord nineteen-hundred and forty, on the seventh day of the eleventh month, man's attempt to conquer nature met a tragic failure, not unlike the downfall of the lofty NÃºmenor. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge, a gleaming testament to engineering and ambition, met its untimely demise.

This grand, narrow suspension bridge, playfully referred to as 'Galloping Gertie' due to its lively movements, finally succumbed to its fate. The relentless, whistling wind of the Narrows, akin to the howling wraiths of the North, wrestled stubbornly with Gertie until, at last, she was brought low. Like a wounded dragon, the man-made marvel writhed and twisted before plummeting into the storm-tossed waves below, never to rise again. Thus, was the mighty Tacoma Bridge brought to ruin on this ill-fated day, a sorrowful reminder of the fragile balance between man's aspirations and the untamed forces of nature.
