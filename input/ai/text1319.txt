Barely, a touch of atmosphere upon Mercury exists, a thin exhalation, a mere whisper of a gaseous shroud. Composed majorly of oxygen, sodium, helium, and hydrogen, it be but a fragile trace wrapped around this small, silence-laden sphere. The solar winds doth thrash it harshly, for 'tis closer to the Sun than any other of its celestial brethren. The conditions, harsh and scorching by day, frigid by deepest night, lend no comfort for man nor beast. This thin tent of gasses, scarce enough to dub an atmosphere, bestows upon Mercury neither protection from celestial bombardment nor hold upon heat. Hence, the realm of Mercury, in its starkness and hostility, remains an embodiment of unearthly extremes. Mayhap, 'tis a reminder of our precious Earth's uniqueness and bounty.
