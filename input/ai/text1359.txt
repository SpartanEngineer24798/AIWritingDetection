Crikey, mate! Back in 1998, the World Cup was held in France, with teams from all around the globe giving it their all. The French team, also known as "Les Bleus", rose to the occasion, demonstrating incredible teamwork and skill. They stood their ground against Brazil, one of the most renowned football powerhouses, in the final. International football witnessed some marvellous matches and it all culminated in France snagging the championship title, right in their home country, earning their first ever World Cup win. It was a ripping good match and a milestone in French football history, I tell ya! Glory days for France, indeed!
