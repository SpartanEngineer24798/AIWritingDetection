Crikey mate! The song "Feelin' Alright" is actually written by a bloke named Dave Mason. When he was part of the English rock band Traffic back in 1968, he penned this song. It appeared on their second album, self-titled as "Traffic." Now this tune, also known as "Feeling Alright," has been covered by a heap of artists since then, including the legendary Joe Cocker. But remember, it all started with good ol' Dave Mason. Ain't that something, mate?
