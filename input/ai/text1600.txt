A "sign of cancer" refers to recognisable changes in one's physical health that might indicate the presence of this deadly disease. Common signs of cancer can include, but are not limited to, persistent coughs or hoarseness, changes in bowel movement, unexplained weight loss, persistent fatigue, unexplained pain, unexplained bleeding, and lumps or swelling. However, these signs are not exclusive to cancer and may indicate other health conditions. The early detection of these signs could maximise the chance of successful treatment. Therefore, one cannot stress enough the importance of regular health check-ups and discussions with a qualified medical professional about any concerns. Such vigilance needs not induce fear or anxiety, but rather empowers us to take proactive measures towards our health.
