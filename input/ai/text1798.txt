Upon the vast expanse of North America, there protrudes the majestic prominence amongst the Denali mountain ranges of Alaska! To the humble folk, it is known as Mount McKinley, a name remembered from yore. Under its shadow, have many a daring adventurer found their mettle tested. Hundreds upon hundreds from lands far and wide yearn for face-to-face encounters with this formidable creation of Mother Nature, enticed by its splendor. Standing firm at 20,310 feet, it is a monument far above, an empyreal embodiment of grace and grandeur; the highest of the high in the wide and wonderful domain of America. It commands over the Alaskan range in an array of snow-crowned peaks and icy ridges. A symbol of endurance and tranquility it remains!
