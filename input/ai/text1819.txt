The Canadian Citizenship Test, much akin to a perilous quest in a tale of Middle-earth, is an evaluation of one's knowledge regarding Canada's history, values, institutions, and symbols. The test takes the form of a surreal riddle of 20 questions, and the answers are multiple choice or true/false. Drawn from the pages of the guide, "Discover Canada: The Rights and Responsibilities of Citizenship", these questions test one's discernment, reminiscent of a secret Elvish code to unlock hidden knowledge. The questions delve into the affairs of government, laws, and the rights and responsibilities of a citizen. 

Much like the brave folk in Tolkien's saga, you too shall be tested alone. A symbol of self-reliance, much like Aragorn's solitary path. Yet, fear not, for you are allotted 30 minutes to best this trial, and a score of 15 out of 20 is your victory, mirroring the Fellowship's triumphant end. Should you falter at this hurdle, do not lose heart, for you may test again, embodying the resilience of the hobbits. In the end, your quest is your gateway to being a proud citizen of this great realm, Canada.
