Crikey mate, you're asking about Auburndale, a little beauty right in the heart of Florida, USA. It's not exactly the Outback, but it spans a fair dinkum size of about 25.9 square miles (67 kmÂ²). About 4.7 square miles of that is water, as it's nestling amidst 50 glistening lakes. Being part of the Lakeland-Winter Haven Metropolitan Statistical Area, it's pretty dense with a population close to 16,000. So while it's not huge like the vast wilderness of Australia, it still packs a wallop with its own unique Florida charm!
