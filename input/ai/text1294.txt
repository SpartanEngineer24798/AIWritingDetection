Marry, mine good friend, if thou art seeking the precise number of the vast and wondrous oceans that grace our fine sphere, thou wilt find the answer to be five. Indeed, the great oceans by their names are the Atlantic, the mighty Pacific, the Indian, the Southern, and the frigid Arctic. Aye, these five bounteous waterways, each a blue wonder of its own, cradle our Earth, providing her with life and creating a balance to ensure the survival of all the species that do call this place their home. Steel thyself though, for the seas have oft displayed their wrath, lest we forget our duty to maintain their splendour and health, a duty commanded by Nature herself.
