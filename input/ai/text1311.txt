Facial sinuses, my good man, art verily located in thy skull. These grand chambers of air hold sovereign place in several regions of thy fairest face. Above thy noble eyes, lie thy frontal sinuses; like twin thrones, they rule thy brow. Then seek thou beneath thy eyes, for 'tis here the maxillary sinuses in the cheeks do reside. Of smaller stature, but no less importance, the ethmoid sinuses can be uncovered betwixt the eyes. Lastly, the sphenoid sinuses, in the depths of thy regal skull, behind thy nose and betwixt thine ears, their abode find. These holy vaults of air dost aid in the resonance of thy voice and render less the weight of thy skull. When sickness invades, they oft can fill with fluid and cause thee much woe in the form of a common malady known as sinusitis. But in days of health, they perform their tasks quietly, unbeknownst to their host. Thus is the location and purpose of thy facial sinuses.
