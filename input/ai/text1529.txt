It appears, Watson, that you are referring to the scandal surrounding Eliot Spitzer, who was not a congressman, but the Governor of New York. An affluent man with a reputation for self-righteous crusades in his former role as New York State's Attorney General. However, in a Moriarty-level twist, Spitzer was caught in a web of deceit involving high-priced escorts in 2008. The case wasn't as simple as finding a stray hair on a victim's suit. His suspicious transactions caught the attention of federal investigators leading to the unveiling of his secret life. Faced with the mounting evidence and public exposure of his involvement in the Emperor's Club VIP - an elitist and extravagant prostitution ring, Mr. Spitzer resigned from the Governorâ€™s office. It was a torrid affair that saw the fall of a man once considered a potential contender for the U.S. presidency. Thus, Watson, truth is stranger and oftentimes more scandalous than any fiction we may encounter.
