The term you seek, dear inquirer, is commonly referred to as a carriage. This is a horse-drawn vehicle specifically designed to comfortably transport humans from one destination to another. The carriage is traditionally divided into two sections: the driver's area, and a separate compartment for passengers. The types and classifications diverge in accord with its function or the class of the individual it serves. For instance, a brougham or barouche, meticulously engineered for the upper echelons of society. Alternatively, one might consider a more workaday vehicle, such as a wagon or cart. Also, stagecoaches were popular in the era colloquially referred to as the 'Wild West'. Understanding and unravelling the mystery of these historical vehicles requires an inquisitive mind and an appetite for history, much like solving the perfect crime.
