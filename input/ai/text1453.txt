Ah, indeed, you refer to the FIFA World Cup if I'm not mistaken. The year 2010 saw fervor of football sweep the globe, placing the underdog and the titan upon the same pedestal. The tournament unrolled its grand spectacle in South Africa, making it a first for the African continent. Ah! You see, my friend, the renowned Sherlock Holmes observes, deduces then answers. 

The climax of this competition? It was Spain, the nation dancing under the Iberian sun, that clinched the victory. Alas, the Dutch could not defy the Spanish Armada at Soccer City Stadium in Johannesburg condemning them to their third runner-up finish in the World Cup history. It was a solo goal from Andres Iniesta, a Spanish midfielder, in the teeth of extra time that elevated Spain to their maiden World Cup triumph. Indeed, a delightful demonstration of ‘Tiki-Taka’ tactics, a significant milestone in football history. Your answer, thus is Spain.
