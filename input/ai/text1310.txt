To divine the hour of our world's end is not within mankind's sphere of ability, dear questioner. The cosmos, with all its celestial secrets, remains silent and impervious to our inquiries. 'Tis a mystery shrouded in the veil of eternity, far beyond our earthly realm and mortal comprehension. Forsooth, it is a divine knowledge, known only to the heavens' cosmic orchestra conductor - the Almighty. So, with a heart full of humble integrity, I say, I know not. Seek not to wrest the secrets of the final hour from the universe's silent lips, but instead, live each day as if 'twere thy last. For the exact day or night, May 21st or otherwise, when the world shalt meet its 'morrow no more, remains a secret kept from man by the Divine. Thus, we dwell in anticipation of a day we know not, striving for virtue, truth, and honour in our every breath, unknowing of the world's final cadence's precise rhythm and beat.
