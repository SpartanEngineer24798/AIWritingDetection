Ah, my dear friend, your inquiry reflects your interest in religious literatures. The Sermon on the Mount is indeed a key discourse within the Christian scriptures. It takes residence in the Gospel of Matthew, precisely between the chapters 5 and 7. This set of teachings, quite possibly one of the most famous from Jesus, includes the Beatitudes and the Lord's Prayer. These chapters display what some might call the essence of Jesus' moral and ethical guidelines. I implore you to peruse it at your convenience, for it provides, if nothing else, a fascinating insight into the societal and spiritual expectations of that era.
