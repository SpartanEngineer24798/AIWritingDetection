Well now, ain't that a fun question. You know Hamburger Helper, that's that stuff my mamma used to make when she was short on time but still wanted us to have a nice meal. It's owned by this big company, goes by the name of General Mills. They're the same folks who make that Cheerios cereal and that delicious Betty Crocker cake mix. Now ain't that something?
