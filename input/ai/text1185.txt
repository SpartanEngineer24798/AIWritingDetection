An advocacy website is like a special online place that supports and promotes a particular cause or issue, such as saving animals, protecting the environment, or helping people who are sick or in need. Just like when we stand up for our friends, these websites stand up for these causes. They provide information about these issues, tell people how they can help, and work to make changes that improve the situation. They believe really strongly in their cause and try to encourage others to join them in supporting it. It's like a team with an important mission, and their website helps them share this mission with as many people as possible.
