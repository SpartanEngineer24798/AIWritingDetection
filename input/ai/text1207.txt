The Montreal Expos became the Washington Nationals in 2005. The Montreal Expos were a professional baseball team in Canada from 1969 until 2004. But due to several problems like troubled finances and poor attendance, the team was moved to Washington D.C. and they were renamed the Washington Nationals. So, before 2005, they were the Expos from Canada, but now they're the Nationals from the United States.
