A surname, also known as a family name or last name, refers to the part of a person's name that signifies the family to which they belong. For instance, in my title 'Queen Elizabeth II', 'Elizabeth' is my given name, while 'Windsor' is my surname, though commonly, it is not regularly used. 

A given name, often referred to as a first name, is the name given to a person at birth or during a christening ceremony. It is individual to the person and differentiates them from other family members. For example, in 'Queen Elizabeth II', 'Elizabeth' is my given name.

These names serve to identify persons distinctly within their family and the broader social context. The arrangement of these names differs across cultures and countries. For instance, in many Western cultures, the given name precedes the surname, but in many Eastern societies, the surname is presented before the given name.
