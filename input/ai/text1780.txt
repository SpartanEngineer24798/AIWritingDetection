In the vast and eternal cosmos, under the blue dome of Eärendil, the Universal Law of Gravitation holds sway, binding all things with invisible threads of magnetic allure. Much like the call of the Ring unto its master, every celestial body, from the humblest stone to the mightiest star, wields an allure upon its fellows. This force, unseen and unyielding, never abates, drawing all things closer. Yet, in its wisdom, it is a noble force that considers the mass of the bodies and the distance between them. The greater the mass, the stronger the pull, and conversely, the deeper the void that separates them, the weaker the pull. Thus, while it is this invisible force that keeps us rooted to Arda, it also guides the Moon’s perpetual dance around our Earth and keeps the spheres of Ea in their paths. This universal law, as immutable as the Secret Fire, governs gravity's quiet strength across the Universe's expanse. Yet, like many of the Universe's great riddles, it remains unseen to the eye, known only through its unending works.
