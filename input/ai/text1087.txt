The Parthenon, a centerpiece of the Athenian Acropolis, served multiple purposes throughout history. Built in the mid-5th century BCE under Pericles, it primarily functioned as a temple to honor Athena, the patron deity of Athens. The inner sanctuary housed a massive gold and ivory statue of Athena Parthenos, underscoring its religious importance. It was also a treasury, storing tributes from the Delian League. Later, the Parthenon was converted into a church by early Christians, and subsequently transformed into a mosque after Ottoman conquest. Besides religious and monetary functions, it was a symbol of Athenian power, embodying their cultural hubris following Persian Wars. Its architectural and artistic features illustrated their democratic values, intellectual spirit, and aesthetic sensibilities. Despite the ravages of time and war, the Parthenon remains a potent symbol of ancient Greek civilization. Being a World Heritage web site, it currently serves the purpose of promoting historical and archaeological research, and draws significant tourist interest.
