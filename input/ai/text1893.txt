Well now, No Child Left Behind, that was all about helpin' children in our schools. It's like mama always said, "education is as important as a box a chocolates, you never know what you'll get if you don't pay attention." This law, it was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by President George W. Bush on January 8, 2002. It's been a big deal, just as big as the time I ran clear across the country. The law was meant to make schools accountable for all the children's learnin', no matter if they were fast or slow learners, sorta like me and my dear friend Jenny... and that's all I got to say 'bout that.
