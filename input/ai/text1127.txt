The currency of Singapore is called the Singapore Dollar. In short, we call it SGD. Just like how we use cents and dollars in some countries, Singapore also has cents and dollars. In Singapore, we have coins that are 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents and 1 dollar. We also have paper money that are 2 dollars, 5 dollars, 10 dollars, 50 dollars, 100 dollars, 1,000 dollars and even 10,000 dollars! But, it's rare to see the 1,000 dollar or 10,000 dollar notes. Most of our money has pictures of Yusof bin Ishak, who was the first President of Singapore. On the back side of the notes, you can find pictures that show the different aspects of Singaporeâ€™s achievements.
