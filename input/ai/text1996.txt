Well, now, ain't that a fine question? You wouldn't believe it but there's a lot of countries nowadays that let folks who's gay serve up in their military. Ya got big places like the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, ain't they nice? Europe is full of them too. Places like Germany, France, and Spain, plus lots of others. There's some over in Asia as well, like Israel, Japan and South Korea. And don't forget about South Africa down in Africa. I ain't sure about every country in the world, but it seems like a good many of them are starting to see that it don't matter who you love, if you're brave enough to serve your country, well then, you should be able to. That's all I got to say about that.
