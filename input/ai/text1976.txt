Well now, I ain't no expert on measurement conversions, but Mama always did have a knack for them. She used to say that everything's got its own special kind of measuring stick. As for gold, it's measured in what they call "troy" ounces. Now, if you're asking me how many grams in a troy ounce of gold, that's a different stick altogether. But Mama would say that there's about 31.1035 grams in one troy ounce of gold. Ain't that something?
