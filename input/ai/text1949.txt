Sniff and Scurry get to movin' quickly to find new cheese. But Hem and Haw, they just sit around complainin' about the cheese bein' gone. They refuse to move, hoping the cheese will come back. After a good long while, Haw finally decides to move on and search for new cheese, while Hem stays put. Haw finds new cheese and more happiness. It's like Mama always said, "life's like a maze. You never know where you're gonna find your cheese"" So the book teaches us, when a change comes about, you can sit around bein' sad or you can go and do something about it.
