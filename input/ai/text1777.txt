In epochs of old, before the existence of time as we know it, there was our world, alone in its celestial embodiment. Yet, the universe had written a saga of destruction and regeneration. A celestial leviathan, a rogue planet named Theia, on its boundless journey, clashed with our Earth, a catastrophe so monumental that it shook the very fabric of the cosmos. From the heart of this galactic maelstrom, a fragment was born, a rebirth from cataclysmic chaos into serene calm. Hurled away from the embrace of its mother planet, this fragment fought against the shrouded darkness, kissing the space with the sorrowful beauty of solitude.

In the celestial furnace of creation and time, it cooled, consolidated, and transformed under silent lullabies of cosmic wonders. Thus, the Moon, the silver sentinel of our night sky, assumed her post, ceaselessly watching over middle-earth, a companion to our planet forged in primal fire and cosmic strife. Bathed in celestial luminescence, she cradles our world in the soft silver care of her vigil, a celestial testament to the quiet valor born of heroic origins, an everlasting saga of creation, endurance, and steadfast guardianship.
