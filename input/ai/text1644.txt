In 650 BC, Sparta, being truly dedicated to military power, transformed its society to focus on disciplining its people and building an invincible army. This period bore witness to the implementation of a rigorous military training programme known as the "agoge". Those of Spartan birthright, particularly males, were subjected to this intense regime from an early age. This involved the teaching of survival skills, stealth, athleticism and combat, with the intention of producing incredibly skilled warriors. These war-bound societal changes reflect Sparta's commitment to military dominance which, over time, led to Spartaâ€™s reputation as the strongest land fighting force in Greece and its exalted status among its contemporaries. By tradition and determination, it became a military state in its purest form.
