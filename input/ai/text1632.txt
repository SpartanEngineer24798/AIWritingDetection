New England is not within a single state, my dear. Rather, it comprises six states in the northeast United States. These are Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont. Thus, one isn't quite correct in saying New England is in one specific state. It is, in fact, a region, an ensemble of several states. So, if one were to venture to New England, one has multiple states to explore at their disposal. Much like how Great Britain encompasses England, Scotland and Wales.
