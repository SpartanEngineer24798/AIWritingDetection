My dear subject, the honour of winning the 1967 National Basketball Association, oft referred to as the NBA, Championship fell gracefully on the capable shoulders of the Philadelphia 76ers. Led ably by the remarkable Wilt Chamberlain, they displayed athleticism, skill and sheer determination of the highest order. A performance that is still celebrated and remembered fondly with the passing of time. It is my utmost hope that this information pleases you.
