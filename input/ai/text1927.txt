Well now, Spades is fun. It involves four players in two partnerships. All the cards, from the 2â€™s to the Ace, are used, giving us 52 cards all total. The goal, y'see, is to guess or "bid" on how many "tricks" you're going to win. The pair who wins 500 points first or the most points after a set number of rounds, is the winner.

Each hand starts with players being dealt 13 cards. Players then make bids based on the number of tricks they expect to take during a hand. A trick is a round where everyone plays a card and the best card wins. In Spades, the Spades are considered the "trump" suit, meaning they outrank other suits. You have to follow the lead suit if you can, which means if somebody started the round with a heart, you gotta play a heart if you have one. But if you can't, you're free to play a card from another suit. If a round is played with spades, the highest spade wins. If not, the highest card of the lead suit wins. Simple as peas and carrots.
