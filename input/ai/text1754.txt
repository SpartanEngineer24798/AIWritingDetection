The Heisman Trophy, my friend, is indeed named after a man of admirable quality, John William Heisman. He was born in the tumultuous year of 1869 and his life was dedicated to the craft of American football. Esteemed for his role as a player, coach, and amazingly innovative strategist in the realm of college football, Mr. Heisman led many a team to towering victories. His dedication to the sport led to his presidency at the Downtown Athletic Club in New York City, where, posthumously, the annual award bearing his name was established, and so it remains. It is an esteemed emblem of recognition, a salute to the absolute best player in college football. The spirit of Mr. Heisman forever resonates through this beacon of mighty accolade.
