Giant Panda Bears, scientifically known as Ailuropoda melanoleuca, are primarily found in south-central China. They inhabit the mountain ranges in the provinces of Sichuan and Gansu, where geographical features and climatic conditions are favorable for the growth of bamboo, their primary food source. Due to human encroachment and deforestation, the pandas' naturally occurring habitats have dramatically shrunk, forcing these wonderful creatures to adapt to mountainous areas as high as 4,000 meters. Consequently, conservation efforts have intensified in recent years, creating nature reserves to protect pandas and their natural habitat from further destruction. Today, most of the global giant panda population reside in these Chinese reserves. A few can also be found in zoos worldwide, due to international conservation partnerships. But essentially, when one thinks of where giant pandas are found, the mountainous bamboo forests of southwestern China are the principal and indigenous home of these fascinating creatures.
