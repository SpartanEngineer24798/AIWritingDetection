Urinalysis (UA) is an invaluable routine medical test. It scrutinises urine, an aqueous solution of metabolic wastes, ions, and organic materials expelled by the kidneys. UA identifies and measures several substances. It provides a snapshot of the state of one's health and can detect a myriad of conditions with resounding efficiency. It discerns the presence of blood, sugar, protein, and other compounds. High levels of these may indicate diseases such as diabetes, kidney disease, or urinary tract infections. Furthermore, UA can detect illegal substances or medication, aiding in not just medical diagnosis, but law enforcement as well. Hence, its scope stretches beyond health matters to dimensions of societal importance. An ounce of UA prevention is worth a pound of therapeutic cure.
