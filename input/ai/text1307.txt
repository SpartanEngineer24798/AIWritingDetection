Milk, thou art a wonder, a potion white, crafted by nature's own hand. Within thee flows the life-giving sustenance; proteins pure and oils fine, sugars gentle and vita-rains divine. Art thou but water and lactose twinned, a marriage most heavenly designed? Nay, more than these dost thou bear within. Calcium, potassium and vitamins dost thou tender, a healthsome broth to the body surrender. Thy whey and casein, proteins twain, the sinews strengthen and vigor sustain. Fatty acids dost thou too retain, complex in composure, yet simple in gain. Furthermore hides within thee a world unseen, of microbes benign in thy creamy sheen. Delicate is thy balance, and rich thy core; a humble provider of life's wealth galore. Yet remember, dear friend, for some thou art foe; allergic revenges, intolerances sow. Handle with respect this liquid pure; nature's gift, mankind's cure.
