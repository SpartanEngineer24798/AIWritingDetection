A fire extinguisher is a tool used to put out small fires. It works by using different materials to take away one or more parts of the fire triangle- heat, fuel, and oxygen. The fire triangle is what a fire needs to keep burning.

When you squeeze the handle of the fire extinguisher, it releases a material, often a foam or powder, from the canister. This material is designed to either cool down the fire, take away its fuel, or stop oxygen from reaching it. For example, a water extinguisher cools the fire, a carbon dioxide extinguisher removes the oxygen, and a dry chemical extinguisher disrupts the chemical reaction.

Safety is very important when using a fire extinguisher. Always remember, point the nozzle away from you and towards the fire, squeeze the handle slowly, and move the spray back and forth. After using the fire extinguisher, it's important to have it refilled or replaced so it's ready for the next fire.
