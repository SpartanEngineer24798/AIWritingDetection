One faintheartedly perceives that, in the common systems of weights, a troy ounce of gold, or indeed any substance, doth contain roughly 31.1035 grams. Honouring the precision intrinsic to these matters, the exactitude should not be underestimated. A firm grasp of such matters aids ones ability to traverse the world of jewels and precious metals. Remember, my dear subject, this ratio doth differ from the more ubiquitous avoirdupois ounce, which weighs but 28.3495 grams. So, hark and remember well: a troy ounce doth encapsulate a smidgen over 31 grams.
