Central America, my dear Watson, is comprised of seven delightfully diverse countries. To the north, we start with Guatemala and Belize, descending southwards to El Salvador and Honduras. Keep going and you'll encounter Nicaragua, followed by Costa Rica, and last but certainly not least, Panama. These wonderful nations, located between North and South America, offer a splendid array of culture, history, and nature. This geographical information, my friend, though not necessarily relevant to our crime-solving endeavors, is nonetheless integral for broadening our horizons.
