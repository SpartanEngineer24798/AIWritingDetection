Well now, I ain't no history professor, but I remember Mrs. Gump telling me about Thomas Jefferson, smart as a whip he was. He cracked open the books and led our nation as President in the year 1801. Yep, that's right, Jefferson done became our President on March 4, 1801. But he didn't stop there, no sir, he served not one, but two terms! That's four years a term, so he sat in the President's chair till 1809. And that's all I got to say about that.
