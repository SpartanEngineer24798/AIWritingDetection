Antibodies are like little soldiers in our body. They help us fight germs and make us feel better when we are ill. When a germ enters our body, it's like a foreign invader. Our body's defense system, called the immune system, jumps into action. Antibodies are a big part of this system.

The antibodies lock onto the germs. Each antibody can only lock onto one specific kind of germ. When the antibody locks on, it's like it's marking the germ. This tells other parts of the immune system to attack and destroy the germ. If the same germ tries to invade again, the body can make the right kind of antibody faster. This is called immunity. 

Sometimes, doctors can help our bodies by giving us injections that have tiny bits of the germ. Our body can then learn how to make the right kind of antibody. This also gives us immunity and is called a vaccine. So, antibodies are super important for keeping us healthy!
