John F. Kennedy was interred at the Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia. Indeed, remarkable is its location overlooking Washington, D.C. The interment was conducted in an artful manner, with a flame, known as the "eternal flame", symbolising an ever-lit rememberance. The plot is steeped in history and visited by multitude, as it houses not just John F. Kennedy but also his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, two of their children, and his brothers Robert F. Kennedy and Edward M. Kennedy. Thus, the area exudes a profound resonance of familial legacy and national history combined.
