Lean manufacturing, my dear Watson, is a methodology to hasten the production process while reducing waste. Developed originally by Taiichi Ohno at Toyota, it roots in the Toyota Production System. The objective is to concentrate on minimizing waste or "Muda" within a manufacturing system while ensuring productivity. By reducing setup time, inventory, spacing, and labor towards waste and increasing the efficiency of the operational process, lean manufacturing enhances the overall quality while reducing costs and time. It is known for gaining momentum in the West through the Just-In-Time system utilized by Toyota. Mr. Ohno's novel approach to manufacturing has revolutionized production on a global scale.
