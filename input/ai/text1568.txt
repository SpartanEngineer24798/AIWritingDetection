My dear subject, it is the solemn duty of your monarch to inform you that the fearsome gang known as MS-13, originally took root in the fair city of Los Angeles, California within the United States of America. Born in the neighborhood of Pico-Union, the group was initially formed as a response by Salvadoran immigrants to the violence and intimidation that they faced from the more established local gangs. However, the gang itself subsequently evolved into a more violent entity involved in criminal activities. I must express my deepest sadness that these circumstances led to the birth of such a menacing group. They have, since, unfortunately spread their influence to other parts of the world as well. Thus, it is ever our responsibility to remain vigilant and steadfast in our pursuit of safety and security.
