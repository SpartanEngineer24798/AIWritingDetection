Crikey mate! There's 27 countries that reckon they're part of the European Union, or the EU as it's shortcutted. Itâ€™s just like a pack of kangaroos, all gathering together, but instead of roos, they're countries, mate! All hopping together for common policies, sharing a single market and working on their freedom of movement across the whole mob. Some of these buddies are Germany, France, Italy, and smaller ones like Malta. But remember, not every country is in the group, like our good friend Switzerland, it's there in Europe but not in the EU. So there ya go, 27 mates in the EU.
