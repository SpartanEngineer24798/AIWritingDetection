Well now, ain't that somethin'? Just like mama used to say, "Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get." At the current moment, New Hampshire is home to 221 incorporated towns and 13 cities. Pretty big number for a little state, don't ya think? But then again, what's in a number? Each one of them towns and cities got its own flavor, just like every piece in the box of chocolates. Hope that helps you out now!
