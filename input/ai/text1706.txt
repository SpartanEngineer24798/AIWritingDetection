In the aftermath of the tragic massacre at My Lai during the Vietnam War, the initially encircled silence was broken, laying bare the ostensible acts of monstrous brutality. The indictment of Lieutenant William Calley incited a tempest of controversy, with him being charged for his leading role in such a heinous crime against the very essence of humanity. He was convicted for the murder of 22 Vietnamese civilians. Nevertheless, his original sentence of life imprisonment was substantially diminished, serving a mere three and a half years under house arrest, thus dimming the promise of justice. His was the solitary conviction, notwithstanding the numerous participants in this macabre orchestra of blood and tears. The cloud over My Lai still weeps for a justice that never bloomed in its fullest extent.
