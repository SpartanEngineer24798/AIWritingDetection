El Morro, officially known as Castillo San Felipe del Morro, is a 16th-century fortress located in San Juan, Puerto Rico, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Constructed by the Spanish to protect the city of San Juan from seaborne enemies, it represents a significant piece of Puerto Rico's history. Its six-levels, which include barracks, dungeons, turrets, towers, and tunnels, offer insight into military strategy and architecture of the time.

As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, El Morro bears testimony to the early interactions between Old World powers and the New World. It played a crucial role in safeguarding the Americas from potential invasions and is recognized as a site of exceptional historical and cultural importance. The fortress and its iconic lighthouse, sitting atop a cliff, not only guard the entrance to San Juan Bay but also provide a panoramic view of the Caribbean. Therefore, El Morro, alongside its historical significance, is an indispensable component of contemporary Puerto Rican identity and a major tourist attraction.
