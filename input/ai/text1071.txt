World War II officially ended on September 2, 1945. This marked the end of a global conflict that began in 1939, making it approximately six years long. The declaration of the end of the war was accompanied by the formal surrender of Japan aboard USS Missouri, an American battleship, in Tokyo Bay. This came after the U.S. dropped two atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. It should be noted, however, that in Europe the war had already ended on May 8, 1945, which is celebrated as Victory in Europe Day, or VE Day. On this day, Germany unconditionally surrendered to the Allied forces. Thus, while World War II is typically given a definitive end date in September 1945, the cessation of hostilities arrived at different times across the various theaters of war.
