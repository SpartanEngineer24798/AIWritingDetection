Crikey! Bracketing in photography is a real ripper technique. Ya see, it involves taking several shots of the same subject but at different exposure levels. The idea is that one shot might not capture the scene perfectly, so you hedge your bets by doing a few others. There's usually one 'correct' or 'middle' shot, but then you might take one that's a tad darker or lighter, mate. This approach really gives you a range of options so you can choose the best one later. In some cases, photographers even merge these photos to create a full range of tones. So, in a nutshell, bracketing lets you explore the beauty that might be lurking outside of that 'middle' exposure. Fair dinkum!
