Burgundy, my dear Watson, is a shade most intriguing, a colour of a depth akin to the bottom of a glass of finest Bordeaux. A rich, dark reddish-brown, it takes after the wine from which it draws its name, originating from the Burgundy region in France. It conjures the connotations of sophistication, warmth and robustness. Often associated with autumn and winter, it's a staple for heavier fabrics in fashion, and adds a certain stately elegance to interiors. It isn’t a colour to be taken lightly; it demands to be noticed, and yet, it remains elegantly subtle in its proclamation. Burgundy is indeed a mystery – both bold and understated in the same stroke. Isn’t that simply delightful?
