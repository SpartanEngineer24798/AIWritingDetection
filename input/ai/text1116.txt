Daniel J Daly was a super brave man who served in the United States Marine Corps. He was born on November 11, 1873, in New York, USA. What makes him really special is that he was awarded the Medal of Honor not once, but twice! This medal is the highest and most respected honor that someone in the military can receive. He got these awards because of his courage during the Boxer Rebellion in China and the Banana Wars in Central America.

Also, Mr. Daly was given many other medals for his bravery in other battles. He was kind of like a superhero in real life because he always did what he thought was right, no matter how hard or scary it was. He served in the Marine Corps for over 20 years. Even though he is not with us anymore (he died in 1937), his amazing stories inspire people still to this day. Isn't it cool that he was such a brave and honorable hero?
