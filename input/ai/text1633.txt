Belize is not in another country, my dear. It is, in fact, a country itself. Situated on the eastern coast of Central America, Belize is a realm of immense natural beauty and rich culture. Although it was once a colony of the British Empire, it achieved independence in 1981. Today, it remains a member of the Commonwealth, recognising the British monarch as its symbolic head of state, much like our home in the United Kingdom. But do remember, every country is unique, with its own sovereign identity, and Belize is no exception.
