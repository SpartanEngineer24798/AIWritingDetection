Tofu, a staple component in many Asian cuisines, is derived from soya beans. The basic process of creating tofu is similar to making cheese from milk. The beans are first soaked, boiled, and then crushed to produce a liquid substance called soy milk. This milk is then coagulated using a mineral salt, commonly calcium sulfate or magnesium chloride. The coagulating process leads to the formation of curds. These newly formed curds are then pressed into a block, which results in tofu. The firmness of the tofu â€“ soft, firm, or extra firm, depends on the duration and intensity of the pressing process. The end product is essentially a plant-based protein resource, often utilized as a meat substitute in vegan and vegetarian diets. Notably, tofu has a subtle flavor, making it versatile as it readily absorbs the flavors of other ingredients in a dish.
