Use taxes are a type of tax applied on goods and services purchased outside of the purchaserâ€™s home state for use within their home state. These taxes are generally applied when an item or service is not subject to sales tax in the jurisdiction where it was bought. Use taxes are usually self-reported and are intended to protect local vendors who would otherwise be undermined by out-of-state sellers not required to collect sales tax. The tax rate often equals the sales tax one would have paid if the purchase had been made locally. The responsibility for paying use taxes typically falls on the consumer, however, this can be daunting due to the difficulty of enforcing and tracking such purchases. More recently, many states have enacted laws requiring online retailers, like Amazon, to charge and collect sales tax, potentially reducing the need for individual consumers to pay use tax.
