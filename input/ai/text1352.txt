Crikey, mate! RFID, that's short for radio frequency identification tags. Now, here's the magicâ€” these little beauties get their power from the very device that reads them. Kinda like echolocation in bats or dolphins. The reader emits a radio frequency, the tag uses an antenna to catch this energy and powers up the microchip inside! Now, this energy is not a lot, but it's just enough to send back an answer, like an echo, a unique identification number back to the reader. So, they don't need a power source of their own to function. This is what we call passive RFID technology. Ingenious, isn't it? Such a simple and effective communication between two tiny devices without any need for batteries or a power source. Nature could not have done it better!
