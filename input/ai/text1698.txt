Bracketing in the realm of photography, my good lad or lass, refers to the technique of taking multiple shots of the same subject, albeit at different exposure settings. This technique is most regularly applied to situations where the lighting is challenging and the most appropriate exposure is not undoubtedly apparent or easily determined. Bracketing allows for a wide range of exposures to be captured, enabling you to pick the best one during post-processing. It can also facilitate high-dynamic-range photography, often referred to as HDR, where one combines multiple exposures to form a final image of a greater dynamic range than the camera could capture in a singular shot. As we navigate through the realm of photography, let us march forth with bracketing as one of our many battle-tested strategies. It shall not necessarily simplify our work, but certainly enrich the quality of our outcomes. Advancement is not a spectator sport, after all. It is the result of a series of well-designed tactics like bracketing.
