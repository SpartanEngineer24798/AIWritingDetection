A law enforcement murder book, also known as a homicide book, is a special type of folder or file. It's kind of like a big scrapbook for detectives. The police use it when they are trying to solve a murder case. They put all their information in it, like pictures, notes, fingerprints, reports from the crime scene, and interviews with people who might know something. This book helps them keep everything organized. It's very important, because it can help the police figure out who committed the murder. It's something only professionals use, so it's not something you would find in a normal school or home.
