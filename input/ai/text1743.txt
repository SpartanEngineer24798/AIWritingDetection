The Jonas Brothers, indeed, are a musical trio of most extraordinary character and talent, hailing from the United States of America. The eldest of the lot is Paul Kevin Jonas II, better known as Kevin Jonas. He acts as a stalwart sentinel, leading the mightiest charge for this group.

The middle sibling, or perhaps better stated, the fulcrum upon which this fine ensemble balances, is Joseph Adam Jonas, who is famously known throughout the realm as Joe Jonas. He does command the microphone with great charisma and presence.

Finally, the youngest of the Jonas cadre, is Nicholas Jerry Jonas or Nick Jonas. Though youngest, he is in no way inferior to his brothers, proving himself as a most capable musician while stealing hearts with his mellifluous voice and debonair charm.

Let it not go unsaid, these Jonas brothers have managed to conquer global audiences with their distinctive pop rock and pop punk music, whilst demonstrating the familial bond that unites them in their grand endeavor. Therein, we have the three Jonas Brothers.
