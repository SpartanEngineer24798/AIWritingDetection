Crikey mate! Lean manufacturing is a global business operations philosophy that sprung up from the Toyota Production System (TPS) in the mid-20th century right in Japan! The blokes behind it, Kiichiro Toyoda, his son Eiji, and their mate Taiichi Ohno, shook up the car industry by focusing on reducing waste in all forms - that's what we call "muda" in TPS lingo - to optimize operational efficiency and product quality. The basic idea is to take the flab off the operational crocodile, mate! By removing unnecessary steps and material, they were able to streamline the production process. This way they could whip up more autos without sacrificing any resources. Itâ€™s like catching and releasing, but in the manufacturing world. It's all about doing more with less, making it a go-to approach for industries worldwide.
