Crikey! Christianity was introduced to Sub-Saharan Africa a heck of a long time ago, mate! We're talking about the 1st century AD. See, there's this bloke named Philip the Evangelist who, according to the Bible in Acts Chapter 8, preached and converted an Ethiopian eunuch, starting the spread of Christianity. It wasn't until the 4th century AD though that Christianity became the state religion of Ethiopia, making it one of the earliest nations to officially adopt the faith. On top of that, mate, different groups snuck in later, around the 15th to the 17th centuries during European colonization. Christianity then further expanded in the 19th and 20th centuries with the work of missionaries. Now, it's one of the dominant religions in Sub-Saharan Africa. Incredible, isn't it?
