Well now, Airbus, is one of them big ol' companies that makes airplanes. They ain't from around here, no sir. They got their start over in Europe, see, way back in 1970. Lots of countries had a hand in it â€“ France, Germany, Britain, and Spain. Kinda like how mama used to get all us kids to help out in the kitchen. Just like baking a pie, every one of them countries played a part in making Airbus. They're real good at what they do, like Lieutenant Dan was good at commanding a boat. They've made a heap of different planes over the years, even that big one, the A380, that's so big it's like if you took two normal planes and stuck 'em together! Makes flying across the ocean a snap, like a box of chocolates where they all taste good. So, in a nutshell, that's who makes Airbus, big ol' company from Europe. I think that's all I got to say about that.
