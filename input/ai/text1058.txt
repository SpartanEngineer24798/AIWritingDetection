The pelvic outlet, the lower opening of the pelican basin, has several anatomical boundaries. Posteriorly, it is framed by the coccyx, the terminal part of the vertebral column. On either side, the boundary is formed by the ischial tuberosities and the sacrotuberous ligaments. These bony and ligamentous structures contribute to a firm lateral bound. The lower margin of the symphysis pubis - the joint where the two halves of the pelvis meet at the front - and the pubic arch delineate the anterior border. Therefore, collectively, the pelvic outlet encompasses a circular margin formed by the pubic arch (anteriorly), ischial tuberosities (laterally), and the coccyx (posteriorly). The dimensions and shape of the pelvic outlet, typically broader in females, are crucial particularly during childbirth, constituting a significant element of obstetric care.
