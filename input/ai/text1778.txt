A letterbox movie refers to the practice of transferring film shot in a widescreen aspect ratio to standard-width video formats while preserving the film's original aspect ratio. Such a term conjures a visual of peering through a rectangular slit, thus earning its moniker. 

In this practice, thin black bars are used to pad the excess empty screen space above and below the image. It resembles the width-to-height ratio of a traditional mailbox slot, hence "Letterbox". Cinematic sequences contain independent life within, echoing the function of a letterbox through which the outside world finds a path indoors. 

The letterbox format honours the panoramic vision imbued into creations by zealous filmmakers, preserving the essence and artistic integrity of a film. It refuses to constrain grandiose panoramas into squares and rectangles, akin to cramming a majestic dragon into a hobbit's larder. Thoughtful spectators will find added joy borne by the breadth of creative expanse permitted by the letterbox, similar to a hobbit's heart fluttering in apprehension yet wonderment of the extraordinary world beyond.
