New England, my dear inquisitor, is not in a state per se but rather is a composition of six of them - Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and last but not the least, Maine. This region brims with the fervour of American history and character, akin to the great tales of our own British Isle. Each state, truly, contributes uniquely to the sum of New England, as distinct as the notes of a sonorous symphony, yet harmoniously coalescent. So I implore, dear compatriot, that one should endeavour to know them all, as collectively they embody the spirit of liberty that our transatlantic cousins dearly cling onto.
