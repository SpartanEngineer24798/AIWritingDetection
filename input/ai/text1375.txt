Crikey! Making jerky is a brilliant process that's as old as the outback itself! What you've gotta do first, mate, is get some good quality meat - be that beef, kangaroo, or even alligator. Then, you take that meat and you slice it into thin strips. You have to remove as much fat as you can, because fat tends to spoil quickly. You then mix up a marinade of your choice, something with a bit of bite, like smoked paprika, garlic, salt and sugar. 

Pop those strips of meat into the marinade and make sure they're thoroughly soaked. You then have to leave those beauties to soak for at least 24 hours in the refrigerator. When the time's up, you dry the meat either by using a dehydrator, an oven, or even the sun if you're right here in the sunny wilds of Australia! 

The main objective is to remove moisture from the meat, leaving you with a tasty, long-lasting snack that's as tough and full of character as a true Aussie bushman! There you have it, mate - that's how you make jerky!
