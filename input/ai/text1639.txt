Indeed, the founding of Apple Computer is quite an important event in technological history. It was on the first day of April in the year of our Lord, nineteen hundred and seventy-six, that two gentlemen named Steven Paul Jobs and Stephen Gary Wozniak, together with a third associate, Ronald Wayne, did establish what we now recognise as Apple Inc. The intent was to develop and sell personal computers, an ambition they most certainly succeeded in. This endeavour did, truly, revolutionise the world of digital technology and transform the way we interact and communicate, both in business and our personal lives. Thus, we should continue to appreciate the considerable influence Apple has exerted over the years.
