Well now, ain't that a funny question? Money in Korea, now, they call it the "South Korean won." Yep, that's right. Like 'won' a prize, but it's their money. It's got that little symbol that looks like a fancy 'W' with lines through it. They got all kinds of bills and coins, real pretty ones too. But remember, in Korea, you can't just be swapping dollars for won. You gotta go to a bank or a money changer. That's what they call folks who help you exchange your money. Now ain't that something?
