Well now, you see, there's this real smart fella named Thomas Hobbes. Mamma always said, "You gotta respect a man who uses his noggin." So, this man Hobbes, he done wrote himself a big important book. He titled it "Leviathan." That's a mighty big word, ain't it? Leviathan sounds like one of those big, scary sea creatures. But it ain't about sea creatures, it's about people and power and stuff like that. Yep, Tom Hobbes' main work is called "Leviathan."
