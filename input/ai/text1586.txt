Web hosting, my dear, is much like offering a guest room in one's palace for others to occupy. Albeit, in this scenario, the palace would be the server or computing hardware owned by a hosting provider. Instead of individuals, they accommodate websites by offering them space to store their files, images and content on the internet. When interlinked through the global network, one could view these websites from anywhere in the world; very much like how our subjects can come and visit us from any corner of the Commonwealth. For one's website to be seen resplendently across the internet, much like the Crown Jewels, it must have a place to dwell, and that dwelling place is provided by a web host. It's an essential service for anyone who desires their digital domain to be available to their subjects on the World Wide Web.
