Well, now, I ain't no smart man, but I reckon the web, or as they call it, the World Wide Web, was invented by a British fella named Sir Tim Berners-Lee back in 1989. That's while I was busy runnin' and all. Mr. Lee, he's a clever man, he worked at this big science place in Switzerland called CERN. He came up with this idea to help scientists share their work easy-peasy without any huff and puff. That World Wide Web then turned the computers all over the world into one big family. And let me tell you, it's like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get out of it.
