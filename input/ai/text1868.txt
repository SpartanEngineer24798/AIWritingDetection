Norah Jones, maiden fair and singer of songs, came into being through the blending of two souls, both steeped in the world of the musical arts. Ravi Shankar, master of the sitar, a bearer of the wisdom of music from the distant lands of Indian culture, was her sire. Fair Sue Jones, concert producer in the metropolitan realm of New York City, was her dame. Thus intertwined, the Eastern and Western harmonies within her lineage, Norah was anointed with a legacy that flourished in her soul, birthing forth a melodic talent unto the world that blurred the lines between divers musical domains, a testament to her richly woven heritage.
