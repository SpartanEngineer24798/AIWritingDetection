The first American flag had 13 stars on it. These stars represented the 13 original colonies that became the first 13 states of the United States. These states are Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island. The flag also had 13 stripes - 7 red and 6 white - that also represented these states. Each star and stripe symbolized unity and independence among these states.
