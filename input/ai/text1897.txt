Well now, if you ask me, I'd say talking 'bout all the money in the US is like talking 'bout a lot of chocolates. You see, I ain't no expert on numbers, but folks say that total wealth in the US could be somewhere around $130 trillion or so. Now, that's a whole lot of zeros, makes me think of all the peas and carrots you could buy with that. It's not just money in folks' wallets or under their mattress. It sure does account for houses, cars, businesses, and all. But remember, that's just folks guessing 'cause it's near 'bout impossible to count every single penny. The US is surely a rich country, richer than a box of expensive chocolates, I guess.
