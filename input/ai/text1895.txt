Well now, Kennywood, that's a real special place, kind of like a big ole playground full of rides that'd make even the bravest heart skip a beat. It’s right there in Pennsylvania, part of Pittsburgh. You gotta head to this place called West Mifflin, it's a hop and a skip southeast of downtown Pittsburgh. It ain’t too hard to find, just follow the laughter and the sounds of happiness, and soon enough you'll be right there at Kennywood. Just remember, life is like a ride in Kennywood, you never know what you're gonna get.
