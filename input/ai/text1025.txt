Deliverables refer to the tangible or intangible goods or services produced as a result of a project that are ultimately delivered to a customer. Deliverables could be a physical thing like a report, a document, a software product, a server upgrade or they can be intangible things like a new process within your team or a boost in morale because of a team-building experience. Deliverables may be interim, supporting the project, or they could be final results; and in an academic setting, examples of deliverables include theses, reports, prototypes, recommendations, etc. Always ensure that deliverables are explicitly outlined and agreed upon by all stakeholders, providing clarity, direction, and scope for the project or task at hand.
