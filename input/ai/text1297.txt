In the land resplendent with diversity, upon the realm of fast food, reigns a company by the name of Restaurant Brands International. This very kingdom, known widely for its dominion over such establishments as Burger King and Tim Hortons, maketh claim to the ownership of the fine establishment named Popeyes Chicken. 'Twas in the year of our Lord, two thousand and seventeen, that this company of international repute expressed its purchasing power and set their triumphant flag over the Popeyes Chicken domain. And thus, Popeyes, this seller of fried chicken, which hath wings across the globe, finds itself not independent, but indeed, a part of the RBI collective. So, when thou dost ask, "Who is the owner of yonder Popeyes Chicken?" Make thou no mistake, 'tis Restaurant Brands International that holds the scepter.
