Crikey! Well mate, the junior senator from the great state of North Carolina, as of my knowledge up till 2021, is a bloke by the name of Thom Tillis. Now this fella has been in office since January of 2015. Before his time in the Senate, he served as the Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives. Quite an interesting character, ain't he? Keep your eyes on his work, could be as exciting as spotting a croc in the wild! Remember folks, politics is full of twists and turns, just like wrestling with a crocodile, so always stay informed!
