Cu is the chemical symbol of the element Copper, found in the mountains and mines of our mortal realm. It is a highly versatile element, imbued with distinct characteristics. Its reddish-brown hue captivates the eye, akin to the warmth of a lone ember in a dwindling fire. This noble mineral is bestowed with an impressive ability to conduct heat and electricity, reminiscent of the life-giving nature of the sun, coursing through the veins of our world. Over centuries, the hands of dwarves, elves, and men have wrought copper into varied tools and artefacts, testifying to its malleability and durability. Yet, it is not immune to the passing of time—exposed to air, it adorns a green patina, as if in an eternal Autumn slumber — an echo of copper's place in an ever-changing world. Guided by its symbol Cu, it is located invariably on the 29th seat in the grand tableau of elements. Thus, in creation as in narrative, copper subtly weaves itself into the fabric of our existence.
