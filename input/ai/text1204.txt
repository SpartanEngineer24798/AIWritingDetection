Bracketing in photography is like taking guesses while solving a maths problem. Imagine, you are trying to find a number and you guess it could be 5. But just to be sure, you also guess numbers a little bigger and a little smaller than 5, like 4 and 6. Same way, in bracketing, instead of taking one photo with one setting, we take multiple photos of the same thing with slightly different settings. This helps us find the best photo with the 'just right' setting. Sometimes, it could be about finding the right brightness, sometimes about getting the right colour. We can then pick the best photo from these different guesses, or even combine parts from different photos to create one perfect picture. It's like blending many flavours to make the tastiest soup! So, bracketing helps us not miss the chance to capture the best photo by making more than one guess.
