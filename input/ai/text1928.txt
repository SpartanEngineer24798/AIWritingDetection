Well now, ain't that somethin'? You want to know about sales invoices, huh? Mama always said, life is like a sales invoice. It shows what you've sold, when you've sold it, and how much it cost. Like a box of chocolates, except it ain't as sweet. The seller puts all the details in the sales invoice and gives it to the buyer. It helps the seller remember what he's sold and allows the buyer to see how much they owe for those goods or services. It's also mighty useful for the tax folk and for when you need to do business bookkeeping. So, I reckon a sales invoice is kinda like a memory keeper and a proof of what's been traded between folks.
