Crikey! You've got a question about Algoma, WI population, eh? According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2010, this quaint little city had about 3167 folks living around! Yes, you heard right, 3167. Now, that might not sound like much compared to some big city out there, but it's a lively spot, full of good people creating a real sense of community, just like a mob of kangaroos huddling up in the outback! Fascinating little city, it is!
