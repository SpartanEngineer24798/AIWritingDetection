Crikey mate, tofu might seem like a mystery, but it's really quite simple, it's made from soybeans, water, and a coagulant, or "curdling" agent. Now, the process starts by making soy milk. That's when they soak the soybeans, puree them and boil the mixture. Now here's the interesting part! They add something called a coagulating agent, could be something like nigari or calcium sulfate, and that's what separates the soy milk into curds and whey, remarkably similar to the process of cheese making! Next off, the curds are pressed into a block and voila, you have yourself a nice block of tofu! It's a staple in many diets around the world, especially in many Asian cultures. Full of protein and incredibly versatile, it can be cooked up in numerous ways, taking on the flavors of whatever you pair it with. So next time you're chowing down on some tofu, don't forget about the journey those soybeans took!
