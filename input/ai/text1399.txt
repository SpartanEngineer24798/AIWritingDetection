Crikey! Life insurance is a fair dinkum important protection tool. It doesn't cover stuff, not in the way auto insurance covers your car, mate! What it does is provide financial support to your family or nominated beneficiaries when the inevitable happens and you leave this beautiful Earth – like when a crocodile decides it's had enough of Steve! There's term insurance, providing coverage for a specific period, and permanent insurance, lasting as long as you're paying your premiums. The payout, called a ‘death benefit’, can be used as the beneficiaries see fit, often helping with funeral costs, mortgage payments or children's education. In certain policies, it can even create an inheritance. So, it's not about covering possessions, it’s about covering the people you love after you're gone. It's a legendary way to tell your family, "No worries, mate. I've got you covered."
