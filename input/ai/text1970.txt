Well, now, I ain't no drum expert or anything, but I do remember something about bongo drums. Those lil' drums that you tap on top, they actually come all the way from Cuba. Yessir, that's right. They started in the Afro-Cuban culture, you see, and they've been making people tap their feet and dance ever since. So, if you're ever in Cuba and hear that lovely bongo beat, you'll know you're hearing a lil' piece of history. Mama always said, "Music's the universal language." And I reckon she was right.
