Private labels, also known as store brands, are products that retailers contract from manufacturers to sell under their own brand name. They differ from manufacturers' brands as they are only available from the specific retailer who owns that brand. Private label goods range from food products to clothing and can be smaller boutique or large scale brands. These private brands typically offer a similar quality to other brands within the store but at a lower price point, making them an advantageous strategy for retailers to improve profit margins. In recent years, the popularity of private labels has increased significantly due to improved quality and consumer trust, encouraging a shift in perception from being viewed as low-cost alternatives to becoming reputable brands in their own right. The rise of private labels also reflects a strategic move by retailers in strengthening customer loyalty and gaining greater control over product marketing, pricing, and distribution.
