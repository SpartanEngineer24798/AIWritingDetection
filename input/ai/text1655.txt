Barry Larkin, distinguished for his divine prowess on the baseball pitch, was indeed the recipient of three Gold Glove awards. These most honourable accolades were bestowed upon him in the years of our Lord 1994, 1995, and 1996. Indeed, his exquisite skill in defence, comparable only to our bravery in the face of a mug of hot, English tea, has been rightfully recognized and shall be remembered in the annals of baseball's rich history.
