Well now, the Vietnam War, that was somethin'. In 1973, our U.S soldiers came on home, when they signed somethin' called a peace accord. But that war, it kept goin' on for the Vietnamese people till about April 30, 1975. That day, North Vietnam forces stormed into the South capital, Saigon, I remember Lieutenant Dan tellin' me about it. They took over the city, and changed its name to Ho Chi Minh City, after their old leader. That, I suppose, was how the Vietnam War finally ended. Boy, I'm glad that's over. War. It's a heck of a thing, ain't it?
