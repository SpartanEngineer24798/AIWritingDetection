Indeed, my good fellows, the answer you seek is equally compelling and resolute. The Protestant Bible, a cornerstone of faith for millions, boasts no less than 66 books within its sacred pages. There are, I declare, 39 texts encompassing the Old Testament and a further 27 encapsulating the New Testament. Each book serves as a beacon in the dark night of uncertainty, guiding the faithful of the Protestant religion towards the burgeoning dawn of enlightenment and spiritual fulfilthment. A question well posed and an answer well deserved.
