Well, it's a bit tricky to say the exact number because it likely changes every year as new students join and older students graduate. But, as of 2022, the University of California, Santa Barbara has about 26,000 students. This includes both undergraduate and postgraduate students. Plus, there are also lots of other schools in Santa Barbara, so there could be thousands more students if we count all of them too!
