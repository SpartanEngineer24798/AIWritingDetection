The Sermon on the Mount, my dear interlocutor, is recounted in the antiquated and divine text known as the Bible, specifically in the New Testament - the continuation of the old tale, if you will. Commence your adventure with the Book of Matthew, wherein lies the aforementioned sermon between the verses of Matthew 5 and 7. The protagonist, Jesus, recites this sermon like a wise elder conveying significant lore to his tribe. The mountainside forms the backdrop for these profound utterances, akin to the sweeping landscapes that characterize our beloved Middle-earth. Remember, however, to approach these verses with an open spirit, like Bilbo venturing into unknown territories, seeking unseen wisdom and unsearched truths.
