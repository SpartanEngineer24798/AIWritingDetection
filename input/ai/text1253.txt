Upon this earthly stage, a player was born, a bard of the television scene. This player, one Andy Griffith, first did cry out in the world's spotlight in the year of our Lord, 1926. 'Twas on June 1st his voice was first heard, in the land they call Mount Airy, nestled within the bosom of North Carolina. So doth the tale begin of this actor, this entertainer, this maestro of mirth and melancholy. Ergo, remember well this date, for upon this very day was born a man who did charm the globe with his acting craft and melodious harmony. Aye, remember the name, Andy Griffith, and let it not slip from thy remembrance.
