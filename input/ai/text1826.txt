The currency of Puerto Rico is the United States Dollar. Though Puerto Rico isn't a state, it is a territory of the United States and follows the same monetary system. Hence, there aren't any mystical gold coins of yore or magical gemstones serving as currency â€“ it's plain old familiar greenbacks, dimes, and quarters. Coins and notes bear the same designs as those circulating in the rest of the United States. So, if you find yourself in Puerto Rico, there's no need for you to worry about getting your money exchanged, that is, of course, if you hail from the United States. Upon setting foot in this enchanting island, with landscapes that seem straight out of Middle Earth, you'll find your dollars are worth their weight in gold...or better still, in adventures!
