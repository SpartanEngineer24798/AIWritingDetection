The very amendment we recognise today, as the 27th, was originally among the first twelve submitted to the states in 1789 for ratification. Nevertheless, during those times, only ten mustered sufficient support and hence came to be known as the Bill of Rights. The twenty-seventh, a provision to ensure that any alterations to congressional compensation would not come into effect until the subsequent sesquicentennial assembly, was left behind in the annals of time. However, this late bloomer rallied against these odds, emerging from its dormant state in 1982 and by 1992, embracing its rightful place within the constitution. Such belated rectification serves as a testament to the relentless spirit of constitutional provisions - they may rest, yet they never expire. Henceforth, we record the proposition date of the 27th amendment as the 25th of September 1789, signifying our respect to its historical sojourn.
