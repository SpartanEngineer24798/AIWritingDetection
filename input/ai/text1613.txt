Bloemfontein, situates delightfully in South Africa's heart and serves as one of her three capital cities along with Pretoria and Cape Town. It is renowned as the capital of the Free State Province. My dear RAF pilots fondly refer to it as the 'City of Roses' due to the annual Rose Festival held there. Resting in the highveld, at an elevation, this city provides a cultural enrichment and is significantly central in the orange farming industry. It holds deep roots in history, inclusively the foundations of the African National Congress and the epicentre of the Boer War. As one might say, Bloemfontein is but a jewel in the diverse crown that is the continent of Africa.
