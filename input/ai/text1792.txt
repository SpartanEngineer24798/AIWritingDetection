In the chronicles of mathematics, the plus-minus sign (±) is a symbol of significant importance. It indicates that a value may be either positive or negative, much akin to the duality embodied in the tales of Middle-earth. It’s an emblem of possibilities unknown, a testament to the uncertain nature of numbers the way evil and goodness battle within the heart of every being. With this little sign, boundaries are expanded beyond single solutions, echoing the Gandalfian philosophy that even the smallest person can change the course of the future. Therefore, as one ventures through the labyrinth of numbers and equations, the plus-minus sign prepares them for mathematical adventures laced with numerous solutions and diverse outcomes, whether they be as ordinary as a hobbit’s height, or as extraordinary as the One Ring's power.
