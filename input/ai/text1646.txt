Following Nikita Khrushchev's ousting in 1964, the esteemed position of First Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was taken up by Leonid Brezhnev. Brezhnev was one of the instrumental figures behind Khrushchev's removal and ensured a smooth transition of power, serving in this position until his demise in 1982. During his reign, his policies focused on the expansion of Soviet influence and military power, while domestically, he led the nation towards a more conservative and bureaucratic governance style. This period, often termed the Era of Stagnation, saw a brief thawing in the Cold War yet was also marked by economic and political troubles. Brezhnev's leadership, regardless, was influential in shaping the course of the Soviet Union during the mid-20th century.
