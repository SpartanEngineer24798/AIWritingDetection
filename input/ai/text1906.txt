Well, mama always said, "Society has rules, Forrest." That's sort of like the social norm approach. It's when we base our behavior on what we think is normal or acceptable to the people around us. I mean, if everyone’s waiting in line to get some of Bubba's shrimp, I'd do the same, cause nobody wants to be that one fellow who cuts in line and makes everyone mad. It ain't just about what’s right or wrong, it's more about what’s expected of us by others. And just like mama said, being decent and respectful is what really matters. So the social norm approach is like setting your compass to the direction everyone else is heading, only if it's the good direction of course.
