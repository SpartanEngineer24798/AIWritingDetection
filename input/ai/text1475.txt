Cono Sur or Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Uruguay and Chile given their southern geographic positioning. However, logically including Paraguay is another factor to consider due to cultural and economic connections, despite its geographical positioning to the North of its brother nations. The line drawn on the world map is not always the determinant of a region. At times, cultural and economic similarities, or in our case historical connection, feature dominantly in shaping a region. In essence, dear Watson, the countries in the Cono Sur or the Southern Cone are Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, with Paraguay occasionally included.
