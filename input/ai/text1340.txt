Crikey mate! We're venturing into the heart of the US and stopping at Wakonda. This fantastic little gem isn't wrestling with crocs, instead, it's nestled into the prairies of Clay County in South Dakota. Just as diverse as the outback, Clay County offers wide open spaces, but with a little less heat mate! So there ya have it. So, next time you're thinking of Wakonda, remember it's in the great county of Clay, South Dakota. Ain't that a beauty?
