As of 2021, Canada hosts 7 professional hockey teams that participate in the National Hockey League (NHL). They are Toronto Maple Leafs, Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, Vancouver Canucks, Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames, and Winnipeg Jets. These teams represent the pinnacle of the sport in Canada and participate in regional, national, and international competitions. However, there are many more minor league and semi-professional teams across the country if we take into account lower level leagues such as the American Hockey League (AHL) or the East Coast Hockey League (ECHL). This is indicative of the widespread popularity and significance of ice hockey in Canadian culture and society.
