Ah, it appears we are discussing the dietary habits of the Sus Scrofa Domesticus, or simply, the domestic pig, my dear Watson. Contrary to what most people think, pigs are not the extremely gluttonous beings we perceive them to be. You want to know about their meals, isn't it? Pigs, my friend, are omnivorous in nature and hence their diet ranges from a diverse array of sources. 

In captivity, the majority of their diet constitutes of commercial pig feed that comprises of corn or soybean meal mixed with a balance of vitamins and minerals. An ideal pig feed aims to provide a high energy, protein-rich diet for optimal growth. For our wild friends, they prefer to forage and their diet would depend on habitat and seasonality, including the consumption of roots, fruits, insects, and even small animals. 

However, domestic pigs are also known to eat vegetables, leftover food, and kitchen scraps. One should not forget that while they can eat quite a variety, they still require a balanced diet to stay healthy. Just like us, dear Watson.
