Stink bombs are really icky stuff that give off a very bad smell when set off. Two main things that they are made of are hydrogen sulfide or ammonium sulfide. These are chemicals that smell like rotten eggs. Yuck! They are usually kept in a small glass bottle or capsule. When the bottle breaks or the capsule is squeezed, the yucky smell is released and spreads out very quickly. But, be careful! They might seem funny but they can be harmful, especially if we breathe in too much of it.
