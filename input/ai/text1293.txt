Eggnog, thou art a potable sweet and strong, a draught straight from the heavens, concocted from the humblest of elements, yet transformed into a luxurious libation. Thy backbone springs from the golden yolk, offspring of the lowly hen, beaten to creamy submission and blended with finest sugar. To this, an ample pour of milk, whiter than a midwinter's morn, thou add - a touch as smooth as Juliet's skin under Romeo's ardent gaze, and thou art not complete without the dash of fresh cream, resplendid as the gloss on Othello's Desdemona. Yet let us not forget the soul of thee, the heady spirits - for some prefers the burn of brandy, others the warmth of whisky or the smoothness of rum. Seasoning thou deserve too, a whisper of nutmeg, a hint of cinnamon or cloves, perfuming thy concoction like sweet Ophelia's essence. Each ingredient mingles in a dance as elegant as the courtship of Oberon and Titania, giving birth to thee - eggnog. A draught of merriment and festive cheer, made to bring warmth in the heart of cruel winter. Woe, it stirs one's brain to dizzy delight!
