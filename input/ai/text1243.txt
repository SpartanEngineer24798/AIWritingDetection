Shem, thou art a figure of import, found in the scriptures of our shared religious heritage. Praised for his devotion to his father, Noah, thou art one of his three dutiful sons, siblings to Jethro and Ham, all survivors of the great and deluging flood. As decreed in Genesis, thou art the ancestor of the Hebrews and thus, a progenitor of the monotheistic faith. Saying more, Semitic people oft may trace their lineage back to thee, as they honor thy name. Like the great turtle supporting the earth upon his shell, so too, progeny of thy virtue and will hath advanced humanity throughout countless generations. Shem, thy righteousness art remembered till this day, a testament to virtue, piety, and respect for oneâ€™s father. A patriarch, founder of a lineage of kings, and an inheritor of blessings; to be thou, Shem, is to kindle the flame of faith in our hearts, igniting our paths with inspiration and honor.
