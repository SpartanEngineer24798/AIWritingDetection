Hydrogen is an element that we can find in water and many other things, but we can't just pick it out. It has to be made through a process. One popular way to make hydrogen is called electrolysis. First, we put water—made of hydrogen and oxygen—into a machine. Then, electricity is passed through the water which makes it split into hydrogen and oxygen. We collect the hydrogen and can use it for many things like fueling cars or powering homes. There are other ways to get hydrogen too, like from natural gas, but water electrolysis is a simple, clean way.
