Crikey mate! This brilliant piece of cloth we call the American flag has got 13 beautiful, ripper stripes on it. They are alternating red and white to represent the original 13 colonies that kicked off this fantastic nation. Isn't mother nature incredible? She sure knows how to rally round a symbol! Let's take care of the planet, like the founders took care of this country, and we'll go far. Cheers, mate!
