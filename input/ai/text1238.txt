Prithee, lend thine ear and harken to mine words. The land where Cougar Town doth find life upon the moving screen is an earthly province known as California, in its coastal city, Culver. 'Tis here where the cast doth enact their parts, their art of performance captured in the light of day beneath the warm sun. Yet, in truth, pray remember, this setting only doth serve as the haven of the cougar, donned as a town in the fair state of Florida. Thus, whilst thine eyes may bear witness to scenes of Florida, thy feet would, verily, tread upon California's soil. This jest, this sleight of hand, lies at the very heart of Hollywoodâ€™s magic and enchantment.
