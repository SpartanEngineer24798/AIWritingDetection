Well now, ain't that something? Them Ten Commandments y'all are talkin' about, they're right there in the Good Book, The Bible, yup. They're stepped in two parts, they are. You can find 'em in Exodus 20:2-17, that's the first time they show up, right after God helped the Israelites skip town from Egypt. Bout halfway through Exodus that is. Then they show up again like a familiar face in Deuteronomy chapter 5, verses 4-21, as Moses reminds the people what they should live by before they go into the Promised Land. He got 'em straight from God himself, on a mountaintop. Now, ain't that somethin'?
