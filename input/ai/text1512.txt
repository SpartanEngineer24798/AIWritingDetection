Estee Lauder, my dear Watson, isn't a 'what', it's a 'who'. She was an illustrious woman who founded a cosmetics company in 1946 bearing her name. The brand, a significant player in the beauty industry, produces a collection of skincare, makeup and fragrance products. The game is relevant in over 150 countries, with supplementary brands under its wing; MAC, Clinique, Bobbi Brown, just to name a few. Estee Lauder, the woman, was the trailblazer who implemented innovative marketing techniques such as giving out product samples and gifting products with purchases. She understood the subtle science and exact art of beauty, making her brand a globally recognized empire. However, it is not just putting on makeup, it's about how it makes one feel. It does not merely beautify one's exterior, but rather it uplifts their spirits, boosting their confidence, indeed an uncovering a sense of empowerment. Now isn't that intriguing!
