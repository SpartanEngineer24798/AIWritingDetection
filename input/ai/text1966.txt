Well now, I'm no expert on stadiums, but I reckon the construction of the new Yankee Stadium cost about $1.5 billion. That sure is a lot of money. It was raised up around 2009 to replace the original one. As my mama always said, 'Expensive doesn't always mean better,' but I hear itâ€™s quite a sight to see.
