The army came first. The idea of war or conflict where soldiers fight on the ground has been around for thousands of years, way before we even thought about flying. In ancient times, they didn't have planes or helicopters, so they had to fight their battles on foot. It was only after the invention of the airplane in the early 1900s that the concept of an air force came into existence. So, the army was here long before the air force.
