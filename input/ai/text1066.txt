The lateral and median apertures are openings in the brain that are part of the ventricular system. The lateral apertures, also termed the foramina of Luschka, are two in number and found in the fourth ventricle, connecting it to the subarachnoid space. The median aperture, or the foramen of Magendie, is a single opening located at the inferior portion of the fourth ventricle, also allowing communication with the subarachnoid space. These apertures are involved in the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid, produced in the choroid plexuses, around the brain and spinal cord. Blockage of these openings can lead to non-communicating hydrocephalus, a condition characterized by an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the ventricles, resulting in increased intracranial pressure and possible brain damage.
