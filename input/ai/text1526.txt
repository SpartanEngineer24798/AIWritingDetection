The phrase "Give me Liberty, or give me Death!" echoes through the annals of history from the mouth of one Patrick Henry, a lawyer, planter, and orator well known for his declaration to the Second Virginia Convention in 1775. This poignant ultimatum was made in the turbulent infancy of the United States, when whispers of revolution were thick in the air. It served as a rousing culmination to his vehement appeal that military action against the oppressively overbearing British government was an absolute necessity. The passionate rhetoric of Mr. Henry, a fervent advocate of independence from Britain, embodied the revolutionary spirit that would eventually culminate in the American Revolutionary War.
