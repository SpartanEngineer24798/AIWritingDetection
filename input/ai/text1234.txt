Life insurance, a contract thou dost enter ‘tween thine own self and an insurer, guards thine posterity against the financial strife of thy earthly departure. The sum, agreed upon betwixt parties, is transferred unto those thou leavest behind when thy journey in this mortal sphere is ended. Be it debts or the cost of thy burial rites, or e'en the maintenance of their livelihood, this shield of monetary assurance doth give solace. The insurer doth ask of thee a small sum, a “premium” in their tongue, during thy life. Yet fret not, for the sum thy heirs receive is great indeed. And though it cover not the pain of loss, nor fill the void thy absence creates, it doth provide them a cushion against the harsh winds of financial burden that may otherwise blow against them. In truth, life insurance cover does protect and preserve thine family's estate and give peace of mind. Remember, thou canst not thou cure death with gold, but can make the sting of it less sharp in the realm of coin.
