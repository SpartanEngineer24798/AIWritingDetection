AM-2201, sayest thou? 'Tis a synthetic material, born not of earth's natural bosom, but in man's alchemical lab, with similar effects as the cannabimimetic products doth possess. Like a rogue, it binds to the CB1 receptor, playing tricks on thy brain, veiling thy judgment in fantastical illusions. â€˜Tis not without peril, this man-made apparition; jests of seizures, tachycardia, hypertension, besides the severe affliction to thy mental realm. 'Tis an unseen specter, spurring euphoria one moment, a vile mood the next. 'Tis outlawed, this AM-2201, in many a kingdom, viewed as a dangerous and corrupting essence, with a devilish semblance to the cannabis leaf. So beware, good sir, lest thou fall prey to its beguiling whispers.
