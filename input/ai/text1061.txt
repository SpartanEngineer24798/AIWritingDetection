Psychotic refers to a state or condition characterized by the presence of psychosis, a severe mental disorder in which thoughts and emotions are so impaired that contact is lost with external reality. It is often manifested through symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking or speech. Hallucinations refer to sensory experiences that have no basis in reality, while delusions are deeply held false beliefs that remain even in the face of contradicting evidence. It's vital to note that psychotic conditions can occur in numerous different medical disorders, and not solely psychological ones, including but not limited to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and severe depression. Being psychotic is not synonymous with being dangerous or violent; that is a misconception, and most people with psychosis are not a danger to others.
