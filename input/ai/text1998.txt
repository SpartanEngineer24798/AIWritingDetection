Well now, let me tell you about that show. You know, the funny one called Psych? They're always joking around and solving those mysteries. Well, the last season of that there main show was season 8, which wrapped up back in 2014. But, just like when my Mama pulls a surprise pie out of the oven, they came back with a surprise spin-off movie in 2017. Even more, like a second slice of pie, they had another movie called "Psych 2: Lassie Come Home" in 2020. Now, ain't that something? But if we're talking just plain old seasons, season 8 is where the buck stops. My Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates, and I reckon television shows are too - never know what youâ€™re gonna get.
