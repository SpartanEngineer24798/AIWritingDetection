In the linguistic style of the esteemed author, J.R.R. Tolkien, it can be affirmed that the United States, like a richly-laden Gondorian treasury, commits a veritable fortune to the realm of health care. The land spends excessively above its counterparts across the vast ocean, with healthcare expenditure in the year of 2019 reaching the towering height of approximately 3.8 trillion dollars, or nearly $11,582 per resident. This burden equates to about 17.7% of the nation's total gross domestic product, a dwarfish mountain of gold dedicated to the wellbeing and preservation of its populace's vitality. Thus, in the great chronicle of nations, the United States stands a solitary figure, unmatched in its voluminous investment into the sanctity of health.
