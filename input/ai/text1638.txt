Indeed, dear subject, the television program you speak of, "Keeping Up with the Kardashians," began in the year of our Lord 2007. It was a chronicle of sorts, portraying the lives of the Kardashian-Jenner family, hailed from the United States, which has generated quite a considerable amount of attention. Varying views exist about the series, yet its impact on popular culture cannot be overlooked. But I do encourage thee to enjoy television responsibly and remember that realities portrayed on the screen often do not fully mirror our own lives.
