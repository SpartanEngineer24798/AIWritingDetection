Good morrow! Hark, and let thine ears be graced by yonder tale. A brew most noble, christened as Rolling Rock, doth originate from a land known by many as Pennsylvania, within the fair borders of the United States. 'Twas initially made in a town christened Latrobe, where it flowed freely from its creation in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-nine. Yet, as years waxed and waned, it hath been subjected to divers changes of ownership. Now, it doth spring forth from a place known as Newark, which lies in the fair state of New Jersey under the watchful eye of Anheuser-Busch InBev. So, mark well these words, for the brew of Rolling Rock hails now not from the land where it was first born, but from this new home in Newark.
