The brain has spaces filled with special fluid called cerebrospinal fluid. This fluid is super important as it protects our brain and spinal cord. Now, these spaces are connected to each other and with the outside through little openings called apertures. There are two types: lateral and median apertures. 

Lateral apertures are like tiny side doors. There are two of them. They connect the spaces in the brain to the space surrounding the brain. It's like a door that lets the fluid move from inside of the brain to outside, around the brain.

The median aperture is like a main exit door, but there is only one. It is situated at the bottom part of the brain and connects the spaces in the brain to a space around the spinal cord. It's like a door that allows the fluid to move from the brain to the spinal cord. So, you can imagine these apertures as doors that help the special brain fluid to circulate around.
