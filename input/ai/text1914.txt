Well, now, La Tour de France is this real big bicycle race people do over in that there country, France. Starts from one place and ends in another, takes them about three weeks or so. Run by the French newspaper called "L'Auto", it's like a huge thing since 1903. These folks ride bicycles through mountains, fields, near rivers, almost like being all over France. Ain't just about who's the fastest though, got shirts of different colors for different things. Yellow shirt is the main one and folks kinda like winnin' that. It's kinda like when I started runnin and didn't stop, 'cept these folks are on bicycles. I guess if you can ride a bicycle real good and like seein' all kindsa places in France, might be just your thing. It's like a box of chocolates, never know what you're gonna get. Maybe a flat tire, maybe a yellow shirt. That's all I got to say about that.
