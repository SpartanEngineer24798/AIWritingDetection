Westminster Abbey, also known as the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter at Westminster, is a significant Anglican Christian church. Rooted in the English Reformation, the Anglican Church or the Church of England, was established by King Henry VIII in the 16th century partly to assert independence from the Roman Catholic Church. The Abbey, however, dates back to around 960 AD, and for centuries served the monarchy during coronations, weddings, and funerals. Officially it situate between a Royal Peculiar, which means it falls under the jurisdiction of the British monarch, and a cathedral. It is a testimony to the spiritual life of England and continues to play a prominent role in activities related to the Anglican Communion worldwide.
