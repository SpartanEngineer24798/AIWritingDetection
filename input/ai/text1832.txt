In the verdant realm of Michigan, nestled amongst scenic landscapes, rests the shire of Northville - a treasured jewel in the splendid diadem which is Wayne County. A tapestry of nature's charming brilliance and human's crafty architecture, Northville shares its southern boundaries with another Keep, that of Oakland. Yet with its heart and soul, it remains entrenched in the lands of Wayne, offering many an interesting tale and inviting history, much like the narratives that weave through Middle's Earth's vast expanses. As such, any bard or loremaster seeking wisdom about the realm of Northville would be guided surely by their compass to Wayne County.
