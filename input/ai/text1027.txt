Santa's wife is traditionally known as Mrs. Claus, however, her full name is somewhat of a mystery as it is rarely mentioned in literature. The character of Mrs. Claus has been one of warmth, support, and holiday cheer, making a significant contribution to Santa's activities. In the 1889 poem "Goody Santa Claus on a Sleigh Ride" by Katherine Lee Bates, she was affectionately referred to as "Goody," an archaic term similar to "Goodwife". However, it is merely a form of address and not a proper name. In some depictions, she is called Jessica Claus or Mary Christmas. Nonetheless, the most commonly accepted name for Santa's wife remains Mrs. Claus, deeming her actual first name largely subject to cultural interpretation and creative liberty.
