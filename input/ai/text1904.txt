Well, now that's a good question. Ground pepper comes from peppercorns, which you might say are like tiny little black balls. These peppercorns grow on a vine, kinda like grapes but they're way tinier and they ain't meant for making wine. The vines love to grow in places that are warm and rainy, like in countries such as India and Vietnam.

Once the pepper berries turn red and ripe, folks pick 'em and let 'em dry until they curl up into those little black or white peppercorns we use in our food. The black ones are picked when they're not fully ripe and have a strong flavor, and the white ones are picked when they're ripe, then peeled. To get ground pepper, folks take these peppercorns and crush 'em until they're nothing but tiny particles. And that, my friend, is where ground pepper comes from. Like momma used to say, "Life is like a bowl of peppercorns, you never know when you're gonna need a little spice."
