Well now, if my memory serves me right, the country with the most Muslims in the world would be Indonesia. Yes sir, it sure is. Even though a lot of folks think it might be some place in the Middle East, it turns out that's just not so. Just over there on the Asian continent, there's this group of islands call Indonesia, and they got the most Muslims of any place in the entire world. It's a pretty big country too - lots of islands, lots of people, and from what I hear, lots of beautiful sights. So yeah, that's the long and short of it - the country with the most Muslims is Indonesia.
