Dear Watson, do you remember the map we have in our study? Let's traverse it from east to west through the lens of our minds. We embark at Maryland on our imaginary journey of Interstate 70 and encounter the past glories of Pennsylvania next. Then, we'll experience the swirling air of West Virginia, followed by the Ohio's drive-through countryside, traversing through Indiana's wholesome surroundings, to marvel at the bustling life of Illinois. As we continue westwards, we'll meet Missouri, famous for its Gateway Arch. Yet, our journey isn't over. On to Kansas. Once we've sampled its picturesque scenes, we meander towards the flat panorama of Colorado.

Did you know, Watson, that the I-70 doesn’t just drive past the farms in Kansas, but also up in the high mountains in Colorado giving drivers a spectacular view of the Rocky Mountains? Stunning, isn't it?

And the journey ends with beholding the wonders of Utah, the final state on our list. Quite the vivid journey, isn’t it, my friend?
