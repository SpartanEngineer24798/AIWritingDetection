Crikey mate! William Howard Taft's presidency, from 1909 to 1913, was chock-a-block with political strife, I tell you. Taft's more conservative policies stoked some serious fires within his own Republican Party, setting up a contest of titanic proportions against his former ally, the progressive Teddy Roosevelt. This split allowed the Democrats to swoop in like a hungry saltwater croc seizing its prey, leading to Woodrow Wilson's win in 1912. Taft also got heat from the public when he signed the Payne-Aldrich Tariff, a bill that paradoxically raised certain tariffs instead of lowering them. This was as welcome as a snake in a sleeping bag to many Americans who were hoping for relief from high prices. Furthermore, he ruffled feathers when he tried to break up U.S Steel, a move seen as a betrayal of Roosevelt’s policies. Taft’s presidency was like wrestling a thrashing croc — full of challenges and struggles, with plenty of political opponents snapping at his heels.
