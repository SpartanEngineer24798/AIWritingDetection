Passover, or Pesach in Hebrew, is an eight-day festival in the diaspora (outside of Israel), and seven days in Israel. It begins on the 15th day of Nisan, the first month in the Jewish lunar calendar, typically falling in March or April. The festival concludes on the 21st day in Israel, or the 22nd day in the diaspora. This difference is due to varying interpretations of ancient observance rules. The first two days and the last two days (or the last day in Israel) of Passover are full-fledged holidays, while the days in the middle are semi-festive ‘intermediate days’. During Passover, Jews commemorate the biblical Exodus of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. The exact dates vary each year according to the Gregorian calendar, so it is advisable to refer to a Jewish calendar for the exact dates. Please be aware that the holiday doesn't officially end until nightfall on the last day.
