In the year of our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and forty-four, a bear of great significance, named Smokey, was brought into existence. Conceived by the United States Forest Service, this fine and noble creature, with coat of ebony hue, was bestowed with a paramount task - a mission to prevent the devastating infernos, those fierce and rapacious beasts that ravage our woods and forests. All the days of Smokey's life, he has faithfully carried his message to the masses, a refrain repeated time and time again, "only you can prevent forest fires." This reminder rings in our ears, a clarion call to vigilance against the scourge of uncontrolled flame. A creature of fiction he may be, yet Smokey the Bear's effect is palpably real, as potent as the man-made flame he fights so tirelessly to prevent. Thus, we honour his birth in 1944, a year etched into our history when Smokey the Bear was nobly brought to life.
