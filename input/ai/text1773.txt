Freedom of speech, a cornerstone of democratic society, is paramount. It encompasses the liberty to express opinions without interference or punitive actions. This freedom thrives within the framework of respect and recognition for the rights and reputacies of others. It covers the right to air grievances, partake in robust debate, voice dissent, scrutinise governments and champion causes. It embraces the arts, politics, academia and journalism. Freedom of speech is wider than mere talk. It includes acts of peaceful protest, publishing of works, broadcasting of views and the right to remain silent. However, like the mighty British bulldog, it has its leash. To prevent harm to others, democracies create laws on defamation, obscenity, incitement to violence, and hate speech. But remember, when freedom of speech is eroded, so too is the vigour of democracy. For as long as the lion of liberty roars, freedom of speech must roar too. Let us protect it with courage and determination as if defending our homeland.
