"Stand By Me" is not a product of the rich tapestry of fantastical lands, vast histories, and deep-rooted mythology that my own literature usually consists of. It was created, conjured from the mystical realm of music, by the combined talents of Ben E. King, Jerry Leiber, and Mike Stoller. These creators do not tell their story through pages filled with ink, but through melody carried in the ether, touching those who listen much like a tale of Middle Earth might captivate the imagination of those who embark upon such a reading journey. Alas, "Stand By Me" and The Shire are from two utterly different creative dimensions, yet both convey messages of fellowship and enduring camaraderie.
