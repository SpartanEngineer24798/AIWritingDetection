Crikey mate! The Petit Le Mans is a jaw-dropping event in the world of endurance racing. Inspired by the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans race in France, this ten-hour car race takes place on the Road Atlanta racetrack in Braselton, Georgia, USA. It's part of the International Motor Sports Association’s WeatherTech SportsCar Championship, and it's been attracting top car racers from all around the globe since 1998. Imagine 10 hours of adrenaline-pumping, non-stop excitement! You've got closed cockpit entrants like prototypes and GT cars battling it out till the chequered flag. The name ‘Petit Le Mans’ translates to ‘Little Le Mans,’ which really is a nod towards its big brother over in France. But make no mistake - there’s certainly nothing ‘petite’ about the spectacle and thrill of this race! Cheers!
