Elementary, my dear questioner! The visage that graces your hundred dollar bill is none other than that of Benjamin Franklin, a man of considerable repute and influence during America's formative period. A printer by trade, respected author, leading scientist, ardent diplomat, and a pivotal player in the pursuit of American independence. He was even bestowed the honor of being one of the founding fathers of the United States. Curiously, however, in all of his many achievements, serving as president was not among them, which makes his distinguished presence on the hundred dollar bill a bit of a novelty, as this honor is generally reserved for past presidents. An immortalization that makes him an ever-present part of people's daily lives, revealing that value does not always correspond to position.
