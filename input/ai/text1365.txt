Crikey! The Earth's seasons aren't formed by our distance from the sun but from our planet's tilt, mate. See, the Earth has a tilt of about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun. When your part of the Earth tilts towards the sun, it's summer for you 'cause the sun's rays hit your place more directly. More sunlight equals more warmth, thus summer! When your part of the Earth tilts away from the sun, less direct sunlight equals winter. The times in between, when everywhere on Earth gets equal day and night, that's your spring and autumn. What a beauty of a system eh? Simple and effective, like a crocodile's jaw snap!
