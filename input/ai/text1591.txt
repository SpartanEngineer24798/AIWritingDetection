"Mn refers to the US state of Minnesota. Minnesota, my dear subject, is a midwestern U.S. state bordering Canada and Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes. The state is known for its many natural landmarks, wildlife and its exceptional cold winters. It is recognised for its Twin Cities, Minneapolis and Saint Paul, bustling with sport, music and theatre scenes. It's truly a splendid destination for our interested explorers."
