Crikey mate! You've asked about a ripper of a subject here, a salt ice bath! When salt and ice are combined, it promotes some icy cool chaos, dropping the temperature to as low as a pretty chilly -21 degrees Celsius, or -6 degrees Fahrenheit. The salt actually lowers the freezing point of water which allows the temperatures to dip below what plain old ice water could. This salty ice combo is used a lot in science labs, but always remember, safety first, because it's cold enough to cause frostbite. Stay safe and happy exploring, mates!
