Brain freeze, my dear friend, that jarring sensation that perplexes you when you feast hastily upon your ice-cream or gulp down that icy beverage, is not the workings of some malevolent phantom. It is simply a case of rapid temperature change. When the roof of your mouth, the palate, is subjected to a sudden drop in temperature, your body, the brilliant machine that it is, reacts in kind. It alerts the anterior cerebral artery in your brain to swell and press against the surrounding nerves, which in turn sends a distress signal to the pain receptors. The result: you clutch your head and rue your overindulgence in the frozen delicacy. Continuous drinking or eating going back to the normal temperature relieves you from this deep freeze. The sensation is merely transient, an example of your body's tireless effort to maintain its sanctified equilibrium. So soldier forth, for no enemy, invisible nor icy, shall stand between you and your frosted endeavours.
