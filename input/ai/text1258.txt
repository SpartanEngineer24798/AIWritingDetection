Alas, in the tongue of science, noble Cardinal dost take the name Cardinalis cardinalis. This splendid creature, bedecked in robes of fiery red, is a spectacle for gloried eyes, a brightness 'gainst the canvas of nature's wide expanse. His visage, the hue of a burning ember, offset by the mask of deep, mysterious black around his eyes, truly an elegant sight to behold. His voice, an enraptured melody, bringing joy to the forest and solace to the soul. Cardinalis cardinalis, a heavenly ambassador bringing splendour to our earthly realm.
