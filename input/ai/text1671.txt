Ladies and Gentlemen, I stand before you today to speak of a tale as old as time, and as thrilling as a thunderbolt race. Venturing far back into the annals of history, we arrive at the year 1875. In this splendid year, a seismic event occurred that forever shaped the course of horse racing. It was a grand spectacle, this event, a contest of champions, where equine excellence met human courage and strategy. It was the inaugural year of the now legendary Kentucky Derby, which took place under a pristine Louisville sky, watched with bated breath by scores of finely-dressed spectators betwixt the twin spires of Churchill Downs. So thrilling a spectacle it was, and so enduring too. Little did the punters of that time know that they were witnessing the dawn of an American tradition, one that, with its honest spirit and galloping glory, would transcend the course of time to live on in perpetuity. The Kentucky Derby, ladies and gentlemen, first emerged majestically, from the veil of history, onto the racing map, in that memorable year of 1875.
