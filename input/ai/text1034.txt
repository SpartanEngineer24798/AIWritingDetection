Bourbon, a distinct type of American whiskey, is primarily made from a grain mixture that is at least 51% corn. This grain blend, which may also include malted barley, rye, or wheat, is first fermented, traditionally with the use of a sour mash process to maintain consistency. After fermentation, the resulting liquid, often called the "distiller's beer," is distilled to create a raw spirit. This spirit is then aged in new, charred white oak barrels, a requirement stipulated by the US Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits. The aging process, which must occur for a minimum of two years for a distillate to be labeled as bourbon, imparts distinct flavors and a caramel color to the liquid. Bourbon may be further distinguished through variation in grain proportions, distillation methods, aging time, or blending practices. However, it must be bottled at no less than 80 proof and without any added flavors or colors to be legally classified as bourbon.
