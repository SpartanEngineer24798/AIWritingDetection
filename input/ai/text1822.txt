In the annals of our world, there is a day that echoes with the somber toll of calamity. A day where a peaceful harbor awoke to the roars of war, where serene skies turned smoky grey with grim portents. On the island of O'ahu, in the realm of Hawai'i, that day dawned on December 7, 1941. A surprise attack of unspeakable aggression was mounted by the Empire of Japan, a strike aimed at the heart of the Pacific Fleet of the United States. Ships that rode at anchor with the morning's tranquility turned into burning pyres, their entombment in that sapphire harbor sealed with the immortal words, "Pearl Harbor." So, it was through this catastrophe, in which over two thousand souls were lost, that the United States was drawn from the periphery and surged into the epicenter of the Second Great War. That grim date, December 7, 1941, is etched into the rocks of history by the chisel of sorrow and resolution: a date that lives indeed in infamy.
