Shiva is a Jewish mourning tradition observed after a person dies. During Shiva, family members stay at home for seven days to focus on their grief, to remember their loved one and to receive visitors. Itâ€™s customary for friends and community members to visit the family during this time. They bring food to the family, so the mourning relatives do not have to worry about cooking. People often share memories about the person who has passed away, which can be sad, happy, or even funny stories. Everyone sits on low chairs because in this way, they show that they are sad. Another custom is to cover mirrors in the house. This shows that the focus is on remembering the person not on how we look. Sometimes, people study Jewish texts and pray together. These practices help to comfort the mourning family in their loss.
