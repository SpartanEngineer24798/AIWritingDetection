A keen observation of NFL records, dear Watson, would inform you that the renowned quarterback Brett Favre's consecutive starts hold unparalleled recognition. His iron-man streak, as it is often called, stretches magnificently over 297 regular season games. However, when one includes the playoffs, the number escalates to a staggering total of 321 games. A truly impressive statistic in a sport as physically demanding and injury-ridden as American football, wouldn't you agree, old chap?
