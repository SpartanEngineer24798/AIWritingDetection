Well now, a World War II theater ain't like a place you go see a movie or a play. It's a term they use to describe different parts of the world where the fightin' happened during the Second World War. There was the European Theater, where they were fightin' Germany and Italy, and the Pacific Theater, where they were fightin' Japan. Each one of them there theaters had different battles, strategies, and soldiers involved. Just like how Mama said, "Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get", the same way each theater had it's own challenges and surprises.
