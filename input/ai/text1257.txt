Hark! The elixir of Bourbon, regarded highly 'cross the lands, taketh its humble beginnings so low as corn, the golden bounty of our fields. This humble maize constitutes no less than two score and 5% of its base. Combine it thou shalt with barley and rye, whilst singing songs of joy. To lend it flavor so sweet and strong, one allows it to rest in-barrel, hewn from the oak, and charred to a black. Leave it shalt thou with patience to steep for a few or many winters, guided by verily the very hands of time.  Once harvested from its wooden cradle, 'tis run through with water, as pure as a maiden's heart, to temper its burn. Thusly is Bourbon made, an amber potion for the soul, filled with the spirit of revelry and camaraderie, for friends or kin to share under the vast firmament. This, a toast, to its creation and consumption, in moderation. Long live the Bourbon, we sing! Let itâ€™s warmth spread through thy veins, spirit of camaraderie!
