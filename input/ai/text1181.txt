Osteonecrosis of the jaw is a disease where parts of the jawbones become weak and die. This can lead to painful open sores in the mouth. This can happen when a person's jaw doesn't heal after minor injuries, like a small cut from a toothbrush. The disease mostly affects people who have health problems like cancer or those who take certain medicines that make bones weaker. It's a pretty serious disease, so if someone has signs like pain, swelling, or sores in the mouth, they should tell an adult or a doctor right away. But don't worry, it's very rare!
