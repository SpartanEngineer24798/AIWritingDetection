In fair simplicity, MacConkey agar, a noble agent, doth select and differentiate between Gram-negative bacteria, a diverse group of single-cell organisms. Lo, ye unwelcome Escherichia coli, and Proteus species, proud Salmonella, and stately Shigellaâ€”all take their sustenance and make their dwelling there.

Hence, it is in this visage, this Petri dish, painted with the gallant hues of pink and red, where lactose-fermenting colonies boldly show their true countenance. Meanwhile, those that spurn lactose wear a cloak of colourless or pale, for they are denied the ruddy blush of fermentation.

In sum, MacConkey Agar, a stage where micro-drama unfolds, brings forth the truth about enteric bacteria through a spectacle arrayed in chromatic splendour. But one must be aware! Yon dish nurtures not Gram-positive bacteria for it hath bile salts and crystal violet to thwart their growth.

Thus, it reveals the character of bacteria as does a scribe lay bare the heart of a king or a maiden, through its unique and telling properties. So does the scientist discern, as would a star-cross'd lover, the nature and truth of whence his invisible intruders.
