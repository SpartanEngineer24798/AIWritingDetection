In the manner reminiscent of scrupulous observation and diligent science, the moons of Mars, known as Phobos and Deimos, were unveiled to humanity by none other than Asaph Hall. In the year of our Lord 1877, amidst the waltzing stars and the great cosmic ballet, Hall made this fortuitous discovery while at the U.S. Naval Observatory. He didn't bow to the discouragement of fruitless efforts; indeed, he laboured gallantly, embodying the British bulldog spirit. And when challenges loomed as large as Mars itself, he prevailed. Ever faithful to reason and candour, Hall named these celestial bodies after the Greek mythological characters, Phobos and Deimos, the sons of Ares who personify fear and dread. Yet, in truth, their discovery represents not fear, but the audacity of human curiosity and the unwavering resolve of the imperishable spirit of discovery. Let us raise a toast to Mr. Hall, a true cosmic pioneer.
