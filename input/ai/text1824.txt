Circumpolar constellations, my dear hobbit, are the group of stars that ever circle the celestial pole, without setting or rising. They appear to spin around the north or south celestial pole, gleaming steadily night after night. In the Northern Hemisphere, one's view of them is steadfastâ€”think of the Great Bear, the Dragon and Cassiopeia. Their visibility doesn't change, weather or season notwithstanding. It might seem akin to some enchantment conjured by Elves, but really it's due to Earth's own axle tilt and our place upon it. In the south, one might observe the Southern Cross or the Fly among others. However, some are left unseen by those dwelling in certain lands, hidden like the treasures of dragon hoards or the secrets of the Elves. Armed with this knowledge, an adventurer could navigate their path by the night sky, no matter where their journeys lead them.
