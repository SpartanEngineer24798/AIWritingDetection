"The song, Stand By Me, a classic piece beloved by many, was not the product of a solitary mind but the fruit of a collaborative endeavor. The creative mastery behind it was brought forth by three individuals - Benjamin Earl King, or Ben E. King, as he is commonly known in the music sphere, alongside Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. These gentlemen are esteemed figures in the fraternity of American music. The rhythmic melody of 'Stand By Me' was first enlivened in 1960, with Ben E. King also being the first to record it. Though many artists have offered their personal renditions of the song over the years, King's version still holds a prominent place in history."
