The return address goes on the top left corner of the envelope or package you are mailing. Its purpose is to ensure the mail piece can be returned to the sender if the need arises. It should include the sender's name, street address, city, state, and zip code. The format should be similar to the destination address; the only difference being its location on the envelope. For clarity, writing in all capital letters and omitting punctuation except for the hyphen in the zip code is recommended. Remember, the placement and accuracy of the return address play important roles in the mailing process, so deliberate care should be taken in its inclusion.
