Cashmere, a highly valued material renowned for its softness, lightness and warmth, is derived from the underside of the cashmere goat. Unlike standard wool, which is sheared from sheep, cashmere is collected during the molting season of the goats through a composure process. The primary regions for these goats are China, Mongolia, Iran, and Afghanistan, where the elevated altitude and climate support the growth of their distinctive undercoating. The individual fibers of cashmere are collected, cleaned, dyed, and woven into a variety of products, from sweaters to scarves. The labor-intensive process and scarcity of the material contribute to the high cost of cashmere products.
