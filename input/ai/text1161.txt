General Grievous is a bad guy from Star Wars who is part robot, part alien. He's the leader of the droid army for the Separatists against the good guys, or the Republic. In the movies, he's known for fighting with many lightsabers that he took from Jedi he defeated. Even though he's not a Jedi or Sith, he's really good at using them. He's also famous for his creepy, coughing voice and spider-like movement. You can tell he's around because he sounds like he's sick. Many Star Wars fans remember him for his battles with Obi-Wan Kenobi. He's a pretty cool, though scary character.
