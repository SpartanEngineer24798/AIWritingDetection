Verily, mine friend, a PCI or Peripheral Component Interconnect port, doth serve a noble purpose. In the heart of yon computer it dwelleth, a steed for devices diverse and sundry. Wondrous structures such as network cards, sound cards, modems, even video cards, into this port are thrust, that they may communicate with the brain of the device, the central processing unit. 'Tis an express lane, allowing data swift passage to and from the device. Each of these devices, entrusted into the PCI port, doth gain the ability to interpret and, in return, respond to the commands issued by the machine's mind. So, pray, consider this port the grand connector, marrying varied elements unto the unit, so they might perform as one.
