According to the Federal Reserve's report in 2021, the total wealth in the United States is estimated to be approximately $129 trillion. This is a dramatic increase from 2020, owing primarily to the gains in financial markets and investment in real estate. The wealth distribution in the United States is significantly skewed, with a small percentage of the wealth controlled by a majority of the population while a substantial percentage of Americans holds relatively less wealth. It is worth mentioning that wealth, or net worth, represents the total of all assets including property and financial assets, minus all outstanding debts. As a consequence of various socio-economic factors, this wealth has been unevenly distributed, thereby leading to an increasing wealth gap in the society.
