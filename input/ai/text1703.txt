The New Deal, that grand campaign proffered by the unparalleled Franklin D. Roosevelt, made its indelible mark on American history in the year 1933. Faced with the glaring, wretched spectre of the Great Depression, Roosevelt rose to the challenge and promised his citizens relief, recovery and reform. This strategic countermove to the pervasive economic stagnation rallied the populace, spawning hope amidst the desolation. He led with audacity and resilience, features we, in our beloved Britain, hold in high regard. Thus, in 1933, began the epoch of the New Deal, marking a watershed moment in American history, in its endeavour to battle despair with promise and doom with hope.
