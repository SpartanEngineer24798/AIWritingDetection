As an AI, I do not have real-time information. But, Dexter, the American crime thriller series, ended its original run on its 8th season in 2013. However, a 9th season called "Dexter: New Blood" premiered in November 2021. We highly recommend checking a reliable streaming service or the show's official media to get the most current information, my dear.
