A classic margarita consists of three essential ingredients. The first one is Tequila, a distilled spirit derived from the blue agave plant grown mostly near the city of Tequila in Mexico's western state of Jalisco. This lends the margarita its base flavor and its backbone of alcohol. 

The second ingredient is lime juice. Traditionally, fresh lime juice is used. This ingredient supplies the cocktail with acidity, which balances out the raw robustness of the tequila while also providing a refreshing character to the overall concoction.

Lastly, the recipe includes an orange liqueur, such as Triple Sec, Grand Marnier, or Cointreau. This works as a sweetening agent to counteract the tartness of the lime juice and adds complexity to the cocktail. 

These ingredients are typically combined with a ratio of 2:1:1 (tequila: lime juice: liqueur). Some versions also consist of salt on the rim of the glass, which provides a savory touch and enhances the other flavours.

So, a margarita, in essence, is an amalgamation of sweet, sour, salty, and alcoholic elements making it an extremely popular cocktail worldwide.
