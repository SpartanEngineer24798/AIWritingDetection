The American flag, often referred to as "The Stars and Stripes", contains thirteen horizontal stripes. These stripes are alternately red and white. The stripes represent the original thirteen colonies that declared independence from Great Britain and subsequently became the first states of the United States. Therefore, symbolism is an integral aspect of this national symbol. The use of stripes, in conjunction with the fifty stars representing the current fifty states, truly signifies and encapsulates the historical evolution of our nation.
