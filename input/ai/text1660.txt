If one examines the annals of ecclesiastical history, one would find that His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI ascended to the papacy upon his election on the 19th day of April in the year of our Lord 2005. He was to follow the exceedingly long reign of his predecessor, Pope John Paul II, of blessed memory. This momentous occasion was part of a long-held tradition of careful selection and discernment among the College of Cardinals, signalling the commencement of a new era for the Catholic faith.
