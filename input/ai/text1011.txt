Public policy is created through a process known as the policy cycle. This cycle encompasses five primary stages: agenda setting, policy formulation, adoption, implementation, and evaluation. During the agenda setting stage, issues are identified and prioritized. Next, in the policy formulation stage, various solutions or "policies" are proposed, researched, and debated. The most viable options proceed to the adoption stage, where a final policy is selected through voting or consensus.

Once chosen, the policy is then implemented, during which the necessary resources are mobilized and the policy put into action. The final stage, evaluation, involves assessing the policy's success or failure, and making necessary adjustments. This last stage is crucial, as it informs future policies and closes the cycle.

Public policy creation involves a multitude of actors, including politicians, public servants, and interest groups, and can be highly complex, contested, and influenced by various socio-political factors. Each stage of the policy cycle involves decision-making, negotiation, and compromise, often resulting in changes to the original proposed policy.
