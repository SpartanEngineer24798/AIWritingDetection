Aye, Daniel J. Daly, a man of iron will and valour sweet, born in the land of Maidens Fair, the hamlet known as Glen Cove, New York, U.S.A. He donned the mantle of a United States Marine, fighting battles fierce and many, representing his nation's pride.

This man, oh virtuous and bold, twice received the Medal of Honor, a distinction rare and precious, for his deeds of bravery in the face of hostility. At the battle of Peking in Boxer Rebellion, he held his post like an imperturbable titan, and later during a bloody conflict in Haiti, he braved enemy fires.

In the first World War, he called out, "Come on, you sons of bitches, do you want to live forever?" spurring his comrades towards glory and victory. He was of the Marines most decorated, a man of action, courage and unwavering resolve.

His strength lay not just in his martial prowess, but in his heart so nobly brave. He wore his years, sixty-three in number, and crossed over into the realm yonder in 1937. While his body rests, his spirit, oh valiant and dauntless, echoes in the annals of history and the hearts of his countrymen.
