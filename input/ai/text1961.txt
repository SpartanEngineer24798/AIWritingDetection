Well now, let me tell ya. Them there MS-DRGs, or as some folks call 'em, Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Groups, they came about around 1983. That's when Uncle Sam's government decided to alter the way hospitals get paid for treating folks on Medicare. They wanted to make it fair, see, so hospitals wouldn't get more for treatin' someone with a simple cold the same as someone with a big problem. Like Mama always said, "Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get." And same goes for health issues, some are bigger and costlier than others. So in '83, they put this MS-DRG thing in place to sort it all out. Every illness gets put into a group and that group has a payment rate. So, since 1983, that's how hospitals know what they're gonna get paid for treating folks on Medicare. Ain't that somethin'?
