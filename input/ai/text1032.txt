A Tequila Sunrise is an exquisite and visually appealing cocktail, traditionally composed of three primary ingredients: tequila, orange juice, and grenadine syrup. This cocktail, known for its captivating gradient effect, typically begins with a base of tequila, traditionally a measure of about 2 ounces. This is then brilliantly complemented by the addition of fresh orange juice, usually in a proportion that significantly exceeds the quantity of tequila, making the cocktail gentle and refreshing on the palate.

The key to the sunrise effect and the final ingredient is the grenadine, a heavy, vibrantly red syrup derived from pomegranates, added last. Owing to its density, the grenadine gradually sinks to the bottom of the glass, creating the signature ‘sunrise’ gradient, from bright orange to lush red at the base. However, the taste it imparts is much more subtle; a hint of tart sweetness that rounds out the cocktail.

The drink is then gently stirred or left unstirred to maintain the gradient effect. It’s typically garnished with a slice of orange or a cherry. All these elements contribute to the charm of the Tequila Sunrise, making it more than just a drink, it's an experience.
