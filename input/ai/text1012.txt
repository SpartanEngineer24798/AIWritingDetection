The inception of the internet can be traced back to the late 1960s and early 1970s with the development of ARPANET or the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network. This project, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, initiated protocols for packet switching, which is the underlying basis for data communication on modern internet. But the concept of the internet as we know it today emerged in the late 1980s and 1990s. The invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, plus the development of the first web browser in 1990, changed the way people accessed and compiled information, propelling the internet into the public sphere. The year 1995 marked the commercialization of the internet when major telecom companies like AT&T and Sprint provided internet access. Thus, the internet is the result of cumulative innovative advancements that started in the late 20th century.
