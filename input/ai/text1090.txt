Australia is a continent located in the Southern hemisphere and is commonly referred to as the smallest continent in terms of land area. It is often described as an "island continent" since it is the only continent to be occupied by a single nation, the country of Australia. Offering a unique geographical profile, it's characterized by diverse ecosystems, extensive deserts in the interior, rainforests in the northeast, and mountain ranges in the southeast. The continent of Australia is delimited by the Indian Ocean to the west and the South Pacific Ocean to the east. It is notable for its distinct plant and animal species, a result of its prolonged geographical isolation from other continents. Intriguingly, Australia also includes the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.
