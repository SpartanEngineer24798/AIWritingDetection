"Barefoot and pregnant" is a phrase that some people used long time ago to describe how they thought women should live. They believed women should stay at home without shoes, like they did not need to go outside or work, and be pregnant most of the time. This was not a nice phrase because it wanted to limit women's freedom and rights, like going to school and having jobs, so people don't really use it anymore. It's important to remember that everyone should be treated as equals and have the same opportunities in life.
