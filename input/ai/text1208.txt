Kenworth trucks are built in the USA and Australia. In the USA, they are mainly built in Washington state, Ohio state, and Quebec, Canada. The trucks for the Australian market are built in Bayswater, Victoria in Australia. Isn't that cool? Big trucks being made right here and also far away in another country. Plus, parts of the trucks are made in Mexico too, at Mexicali. So, Kenworth trucks are a bit of a team effort from all these different places!
