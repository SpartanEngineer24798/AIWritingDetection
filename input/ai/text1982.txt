A level of agreement, just like a box of chocolates, shows how much folks see eye to eye on something. You got different levels from 'strongly disagree', 'disagree', 'neutral', to 'agree' and 'strongly agree', and that tells you how much folks agree with a certain point or statement. Used in surveys to understand people's views, opinions, or feelings. Just like me and Bubba, we sure had a high level of agreement about shrimping. Ain't nothing more to it.
