"Who Moved My Cheese?" is a story about four characters: two mice named Sniff and Scurry, and two little people named Hem and Haw. They live in a maze and they love cheese. One day, their cheese moved and they didn't have any more to eat. The mice quickly started looking for new cheese, but Hem and Haw kept waiting for the cheese to come back. 

Hem and Haw were scared to find new cheese and they got hungrier every day. Haw realized that he had to let go of his fear and look for new cheese, while Hem was still afraid and didn't want to leave the place where the cheese used to be. 

In the end, Haw found new cheese and was happy. He learned that change can be good and that he shouldn't be afraid to try new things. This book taught me that we shouldn't be afraid of changes. Even if we feel safe and comfortable, we should be ready to explore and adapt, because changes can lead to better things. 

I liked this story because it shows that even when things get tough, we can still find positive solutions if we are brave and adaptable.
