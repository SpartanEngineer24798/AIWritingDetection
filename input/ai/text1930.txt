Well now, ain't that just a cucumber of a question? Base jumping, if you believe it, ain't about jumping off of home plate or nothing like that. No sir. It's a real specific kind of jumping that folks do from real high places. The word BASE, B-A-S-E, well, that's a fancy kinda way, an acronym they call it, that stands for the four kinds of objects they leap off. There's Building, Antenna, Span, and Earth. Building, that's like them tall skyscrapers. Antenna, that's them big tall radio or TV towers. Span, well, that's a fancy word for bridges. And Earth, that covers cliffs or mountains or anything else that's part of our good ol' Mother Earth. So, these BASE jumpers, they jump off these four types of objects, and then float down with parachutes. Ain't that something? Kinda like flying squirrels, if you ask me.
