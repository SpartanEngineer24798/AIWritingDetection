In the term's simplest essence, 'non-binding' can be understood as something that is not legally enforceable. When we say an agreement or contract is 'non-binding', my dear Watson, we indicate it carries no obligational force. It's more of an understanding or arrangement between two parties that exists in good faith. It serves as an expression of intent, but lacks any juridical sanctions for noncompliance or failure to follow through. However, let's be clear, while non-binding agreements do not hold the same legal weight as binding ones, there are potential reputational risks involved if one decides to break such an agreement. That being said, 'non-binding' can be applied to various other domains ranging from resolutions in international law to an arbitrator's decision. So, remember, Watson, everything that glitters is not gold, or in our case, not every agreement compels one legally.
