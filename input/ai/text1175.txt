The average American income is like how much allowance everyone in America would get if we all had the same job. Right now, itâ€™s just around $56,000 a year for a person working full-time. Think about it like this: if you got $5 every week for allowance, that would be $260 a year. So, the average American makes a lot more than that! Just remember, not everybody earns the same amount. Some people make a lot more, and some people make a lot less. It's just like chores at home: maybe your older sister makes more because she does tougher jobs, or maybe your neighbor gets less because he only has to take out the trash.
