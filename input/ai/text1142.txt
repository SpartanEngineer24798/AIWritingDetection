The Girls from the Bad Girls Club are a group of women who appear in a reality TV show called "Bad Girls Club." This TV show is created by Bunim/Murray Productions and aired on the Oxygen Network. The show selects seven to fourteen misbehaving women referred to as "bad girls" from different parts of the USA. The girls have to live together in a luxurious mansion for three months. Each season introduces a new group of girls who are seen as aggressive, rebellious, or have other issues. The girls are expected to change their behavior for the better by living together and supporting each other. However, often the girls get into arguments or fights instead of helping each other. Just like in other reality TV shows, every week, we watch what happens in their lives. Please note this show may not be suitable for children because of its strong language and fights.
