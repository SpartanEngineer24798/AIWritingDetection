As the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, I'll deduce the solution for your inquiry. The country with the highest Muslim population isn't located in the Middle East as one might initially presume, but farther Eastâ€“in the Southern Asian archipelago of Indonesia. The truth is undeniable, my dear inquisitor, with approximately 227 million followers of Islam, Indonesia surpasses any other country on this globe in terms of Muslim population. A close observation of global demographics consistently confirms this fact, despite its distance from the religious epicentres of Mecca and Medina. Hence, the answer to your query, my friend, is Indonesia.
