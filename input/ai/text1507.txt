"Ah, a classic novel turned cinema by Mr. Stanley Kubrick, if I remember correctly. Sue Lyon, the actress who played the highly contentious role of Lolita, I can deduce was born on July 10th in the year 1946. The film was released in June 1962. Therefore, my dear Watson, if we subtract the release date from her date of birth, the result would infer that Ms. Lyon was in fact approximately fifteen or sixteen years old during the film's production process. As you well know, such a role at such a tender age was quite controversial and provocative, was it not?"
