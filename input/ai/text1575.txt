One's humble duty is to inform thee that the television show "SpongeBob SquarePants," noted for its cheery underwater escapades, had its first presentation unto the world on the first day of the month of May in the year of our Lord, nineteen hundred and ninety-nine. That very moment marked the beginning of jocund jest and mirth, delighting children and adults alike across the globe. The charming series swiftly became a staple of the American television network, Nickelodeon. How marvellous it is to witness the power of animation!
