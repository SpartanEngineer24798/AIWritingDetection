In the realms of history, not unlike the intricate world-building I do, there exists an episode called the 'Cash and Carry' principle and the 'Lend-Lease'. These terms were initially coined during the ominous rumblings of the Second World War. The Cash and Carry principle, implemented via the Neutrality Act of 1939 by President Roosevelt, reversed previous policies and allowed nations at war to purchase goods and arms from the U.S provided they paid upfront and transported them in their own vessels.

However, as the war intensified, Britain could no longer afford to pay cash for her requirements. Thus, was born the Lend-Lease Act in 1941, a policy granting the President the authority to sell, transfer, exchange, lease, or lend war materials to any nation he deemed vital for the defence of the U.S. Much like how Bilbo Baggins lent his precious Sting to Frodo in times of need, so did America lend its resources to beleaguered nations, an act that marked a turning point in the war.
