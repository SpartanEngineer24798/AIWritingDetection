Well, Paul Avery was a journalist fella. You see, he worked for the San Francisco Chronic-le, you know, the big ol' newspaper? Now, the Zodiac Killings, that was a mighty scary time. Some fella or missy, we don't rightly know, was killin' people and sending letters about it. Well, Mr. Avery, he started reportin' on those there letters and the killings. He was real good too, got himself a lot of attention. But then, oh boy, he got a Halloween card in the mail from the Zodiac himself. Gave everyone quite the scare, I tell ya. Avery even started wearin' a button that said, "I AM NOT PAUL AVERY." He moved on to other work, but that Zodiac business, it followed him around for years. That's all I have to say about that.
