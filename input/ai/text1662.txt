A map, as one may rightfully construe, is a symbolic representation of physical features or elements upon Earth's geography. It serves to examine relative placement of objects and navigate physical landscapes, with the grand intent of aiding one's understanding of spaces possessed of multifaceted complexities. Furthermore, one may potentially express abstract notions upon a map, such as demographic data or economic trends. A map oft contains varied elements such as scales representing distances, symbols standing for landmarks, and a legend to decipher it all. Moreover, dear subjects, types of maps run a broad spectrum, from physical and political sorts to topographic and street maps. Each type has its own usage under the sovereign grace of cartography, the very art and science of creating these beneficial tools. An aptly drawn map is, verily, the compass by which we all might chart our course through life's oft-confounding terrain.
