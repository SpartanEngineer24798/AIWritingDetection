Crikey! That's a pretty easy one, mate! "Puff, the Magic Dragon" is a song written by the American duo known as Peter, Paul and Mary back in 1963. Leonard Lipton and Peter Yarrow are the blokes who came up with the lyrics. Yarrow wrote the music for it too. It's a bonzer song, often mistaken as a euphemism for smoking marijuana, but it's really a tune about a childhood story of a magical dragon. Quite the misunderstood masterpiece wouldn't ya say? Talk about getting the wrong end of the stick, mate!
