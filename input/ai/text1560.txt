The revered franchise of Pokémon, my dear ones, had its humble beginnings in the land of the Rising Sun, Japan. The birth year of this delightful entity was 1996. The progenitors, Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori, collaborated with the noble house of Game Freak and brought into existence a pair of games for the Game Boy, initially released by Nintendo, under the name of 'Pocket Monsters', colloquially known as Pokémon. Destiny had even grander plans for Pokémon, as its popularity grew exponentially, conquering lands and hearts far beyond its homeland. Pokémon metamorphosed into an umbrella of various entertainment forms including animated television series, movies, trading card games, toys, and much more. One could not have fathomed its profound impact on popular culture, resonates till this day.
