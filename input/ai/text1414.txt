Crikey, mate! You're talking about Daylight Saving Time - something many people might have a bit of a wrestle with, just like wrestling a saltie (saltwater crocodile)! Well, this is a practice that was first implemented during World War I, around the year 1916. The idea was to take advantage of longer daylight hours during the warmer parts of the year, save energy, and give people an extra hour of sunlight... sort of like giving a kangaroo an extra hop, if you will. Germany was the first country to put this into action. In the good old land Down Under, we started adopting it around 1917. But remember, not every country or every state uses Daylight Saving Time, and the dates it starts and stops vary, just like different critter's breeding seasons. Now, isn't that interesting?
